## Orientalization of videogames

The Orientalisation  of Video-Gaming & The Dogma of "Balance" & The Supremacy of Modding [THREAD 3/13/19]

think of all the monsters that the dumbing down of video-games has created

instead of spending man hours figuring out how to navigate overly complex and completely unbalanced multiplayer pvp games the nerds of the early 2000s are using that energy to violently collapse society (I DISAVOW! I DISAVOW!)
if you REALLY want to save society bring back overly complex unbalanceable games that arent dumbed down for retards who need a meta to figure out how to be good at something
IM NOT RACIST BUT if games like starcraft had not attempted to be so obsessed with balance and quelling chaotic game elements, whites would still be better at starcraft than east asians
IM NOT RACIST BUT the only reason east asians are so good at current gen RTS and MOBA is only because the developers are obsessed with balance which creates a META that translates to "this is the right way to play this patch to win"
IM NOT RACIST BUT if games were still chaotic and unbalanced like the early 2000s then i would put money on whites still being the top in MOBA and RTS leagues which in turn would revive the genres
IM NOT RACIST BUT this is the same reason east asians are so good at standarised tests and excel at rote memorisation, they accommodate this slyly by creating metas, WHILE WHITES simply are better at adapting and creating ordered structures out of chaos
IM NOT RACIST BUT unbalanced games require creativity to innovate new metas out of the chaos of unbalance, while balanced games require rote memorisation to learn correct counter and counter-metas. whites excel at the former and east asians at the latter
TO SAVE PROFESSIONAL ESPORTS FROM ASIA ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS MAKE YOUR GAMES AS CHAOTIC AND UNBALANCED AS POSSIBLE EVERYTHING SHOULD BE OVERPOWERED
IM NOT RACIST BUT mods in video games are an implicit last stand of white culture
IM NOT RACIST BUT chaotic custom/modded games are like white ethnostates while BALANCED META competitive play is more like shenzhen
IM NOT RACIST BUT if you played games like troll tribes on wc3 in early 2000s you were white if you played DoTA on wc3 you were probably white too if you play dota or any moba now you probably arent physically or spiritually white
REMEMBER HALO CE CUSTOM EDITION? thats the true last stand of white culture...


## Be like water

Why You Should Never Box Yourself In With Fleeting Identities, or "BE LIKE WATER!"

I have always been very weary even since being a young child to identify with anything, some people ask me 'Sunny, what are you? What do you consider yourself?' They list out names of things youd see under someones name if they were to appear on television; I'll settle for madman

Once you have titled yourself, given yourself up to some pitiful noun, you have trapped yourself and your mind, if not in your mind but surely in the minds of others. In this box you will be trapped, what will you do? A box may be comfortable, but you will run out of air

Who are you? Who are you? Who are you? They ask, they ask, they ask. Why? For what reason? He who does not know himself, knows himself. He who understands that he can not be, but is, becomes. He who settles to be nothing, can flourish as everything.

He who boxes himself in, and attests that alas he has found himself has lost himself. He who lets others put him in a box has scarified his freedom. Only through the shedding of desire to find oneself, may one truly find themselves

One you are stood at an abyss, hopeless truly, this and only this will be the moment you find yourself. Knowing this, you must shed yourself and accept the eternal way, be like water, be like water, be like water. How many times do I have to say it? BE LIKE WATER

## China bad

On The Dogma of China Bad or "YOU ARE NOT IMMUNE TO PROPGANDA" [THREAD, 5/3/19]
Google and Intel: ONLY WE'RE ALLOWED TO SPY 
Posted from my Huawei Mate 20 Pro (Banned in the US, and DeGoogled)

CAN'T WAIT FOR HUAWEI TO MAKE THEIR OWN OS AND CHIPS AND FORCE GOOGLE AND INTEL TO INNOVATE 

Oh my God this is horrible, Huawei phones won't be able to use Google Spyware anymore and glow in the dark intel chips. WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO NOW?????? 

ATTENTION ALL EDGELORDS AND IRONY BROS HUAWEI IS NOW THE MOST EDGY ELECTRONICS BRAND YOU CAN BUY PASS IT ON

Wish the Chinese government would see I'm typing this from my Huawei Phone and look at all my self made Chinese Truthaganda and thought "hey we a should re ah cruit dis guy" FUCKING HIRE ME

HEY GUYS: HERE'S HOW TO SAVE THE WEST STEAL CHINAS POLITICAL SYSTEM EXCEPT MAKE IT WITH WESTERN VALUES THERE'S A WORD FOR IT BUT IM NOT ALLOWED TO SAY IT... :shy:

China is the SINGLE example of a modern state doing ANYTHING right, and right and left wingers alike are too blinded by propaganda

> BUT SUNNY LOOK AT THESE WEBMS OF FAILING INFRASTRUCTURE IN CHINA
> look at this car crash PEOPLE JUST WALKED BY.. oh my God NO!!!!!!
Yeah okay look at transgender preschool drag queens learning how to have VRChat Erotica Roleplay, FUCK YOU

Yeah China is outpacing everyone cus they're evil, 
China Bad, 
China Bad, 
Ommmmm, 
Ommmmmm.

IMAGINE AN ANGLO SAXON WORLD STATE THAT OPERATED LIKE CHINA 
> "Oh but Sunny... the social credit system" 
*-gets fired for saying you support milk toast politicians and banks won't give you loans and paypal bans you*-

CHINESE COMPANIES ARE OWNED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND WILL BAN YOU FOR SAYING STUFF AGAINST THEIR AGENDA WE CANNOT ALLOW THEM IN THE US
 thinks to myself:
>god i hope today's not the day my life is ruined for being centre right haha, at least we're not China

Look up on YouTube vlogs in Shenzhen, Beijing, and Shanghai then tell me you don't wish your major cities felt so safe

> yeah so apparently there's poo in some Chinese cities lol... you think we should emulate them haha... ur nuts
*goes to work at my Google job in san francisco avoiding lgbt, homeless, and human feces alike with a special app on my phone*

[Yeah anyways I'm just kidding China sucks...!! I would much rather live in San Francisco than Shenzhen i mean just look at this crime ridden... SHIT HOLE the camera man is BRAVE for bracing this city at night...
(https://youtube.com/watch?v=1lXC951HI74)
Why are so many little kids left unattended in China? these parents are neglectful! don't they know bad hombres could kidnap and rape their progeny at any time?? where are the leashes?? I'm APPALLED...

God these videos of markets in Beijing are SICKENING just saw a little girl with an iPhone selling some sort of juice here are my issues 
1.UHM hello, Child Labour??? 
2. WHERE'S YOUR PERMIT??? 
3. how does SHE have an iPhone?? 
4. WHO DO I CALL TO REPORT THIS???

China's blatant disregard for IP reminds me of that.. terrible thing....
In America we're civilised unlike China, we punish children who make illegal lemonade stands they need to be paying taxes and child labour is ILLEGAL

ONLY ISRAEL IS ALLOWED TO SPY ON YOU AND ALSO AMERICA BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO MONITOR THERE'S NO DANGEROUS ANTISEMITISM CHINA HAS NO RIGHT TO SPY ON THE CHOSEN PEOPLE

IN THE NEAR FUTURE wignats and identitarians will be forced to choose between an Israeli-USZOG Coalition vs a Chinese Coalition and they will overwhelmingly side against their interests and cementing their place as an extinct race

>BUT THE CHINESE WOULD GENOCIDE US... AT LEAST THE ISRAELIS WILL TREAT US LIKE SLAVES!
Yes just like National Socialist Germany is the comic book evil superhero HELLBENT on complete and utter genocide of ANYONE who isn't a blonde haired blue eyed superhuman

The ZOG (a fictional nation like the 'flood' in my personal 40k fanfic) has blinded The West so intensely that it has fought war after war after war and every single time only generations later will anyone question it, but this next war? Yeah its totally different

China IS evil. Just like Apartheid South Africa, just like Nazi Germany, just like Franco Spain, just Iike Rhodesia, just like The Confederacy America is always the good guy and we're never fighting against our own interests. This time will be different

*lives in a totalitarian technocratic police and surveillance state that masquerades as a democratic republic* 
I VALUE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY AND DONT BELIEVE ANY CRACKPOT CONSPIRACY THEORIES. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND FUCK CHINA.

## Cybersteppe

On The Cyber-Scythian Migration From Something Awful, to /b/, to /a/, to /jp/ to The Vast Cybersteppe or "Why it's a good thing most of 4chan's history is unwritten" & The Natural Supremacy of Shitposting Culture

>Just realized what giant part of 4chan folklore is simply lost and people don't know about it at all… Post 2016 4chan has completely erased the previous wilderness, people can no longer find it… The pickles and office cougars greentexts, the an hero stuff. It's erased!
>Neo-normies are able to access the new 4chan culture, which is a reaction against tumblr culture, which is a reaction against original wilderness of the 2013 era 4chan. It was chaos, insults, schizos, porno, doxing, supporting random bros, gore, fucked up shit… Truly a lost era

This is a good thing, normies shouldn't be able to access any of that. Those that experienced this, know. And those that didn't, don't. This is how it should be, 4chan died in 2013, and the culture was exiled. Now we diaspora wander, I don't want people pretending cus read KYM.

Is there possible that a place like 2013 4chan exist today on the internet? Or is it all relegated to discord groups now

Just as this culture transcended SA, and those site's before it, the Flame of Cyber-Antiquity Funposting lives on in all those who experienced who can light the minds of those like us, when we were young and we were dumb.

We have tried similar things with Chen^2, but the imageboard has lost its virility I believe as the fire of that tradition, and the fire has spread out to many different networks, however a fire is still a fire

This has not diminished the flame of culture but allowed its growth, the seeds are being planted everywhere Just a cursory look at my and Miya's part of twitter should tell you this spirit is alive, and well

On other sites it lives free, in semi-private discord servers, and closed BBS's, encrypted telegram groups, and world chats in MMOs, there is nowhere you can escape it online anymore

Many do not 'get' the culture, they can only mimic but for every 10 who mimic and grow out of it, 1 will 'get' it, and understand the fundamental daoist nature of the shitpost culture

Internet culture reproduces through stuff like this, the oldguard of many has become stale. They have accepted reddit ideas and dogma, so they do not seek to preserve the flame, only worship the ashes. Intrepidly they pass around screenshots of old, reminiscing

But there are mindwicks ready to be lit aflame yet their calls to inflammation go unanswered, for what? Because they think kids these days wont 'get' it? How lofty can you think yourselves When you only reminisce and don't teach, your culture dies Why celebrate death?

The unique cycle of the culture is gone, those of us that remember, remember well and it's engrained into our psych. A fastwire for connecting to the Cyberdao, is this what they meant by indigo children?

But the tradition does not die there, only the weak and beta millenial 4channers who have lost their verility and banally long for an age long gone. The fun I have had being a dickhead on this site outweighs anything on 4chan since 2016, HANDS DOWN

The culture has evolved, and moved. Are you a flag bearer of an active vibrant culture, enforcing its cultural norms and morality, or have you just accepted its death like a coward and molded into the new post-facebookian mesh? 

## Miya effect

On Wu-Wei, The Miya Effect, Boomers, Zoomers, Midwits & Indigo-Children

The Cyber Daoist art of crafting superfluous elaborate intricate online lies, this in such a way to leave a fog of war over your persona. Crafting elaborate details of one's meatspace life, with none other reason than bait on hooks. Once you bite, bam.

The @BPD_GOD effect.

    - When someone mentions your bio, they lose.
    - When you put truths on your bio, you lose.

Remember, remember.

How the shadowed incognito bugman will shout:

>    “look at their bio! they have pronouns but are spreading race hate!” 

>    “they are a girl but preaching female subjugation!” 

>    “no wait they're a self hating 🚂!” 

Are you afraid of Miya, or Miyas ideas? Are you afraid?

Imagine such attachment to perceived meat storage identity, a projection of not just ones insecurity over it but rather a projection of just how unwired these people are, how slovenly & unable to read between the lines they are, are these NPCs? The answer will surprise you

Yes!

What I mean by this is, this is the average Facebook user, the one who sets up a patreon, a gofundme, the one that tells others irl about how they are in twitter or Facebook “jail”, an out of touch grifter with no skin in the game.

There exists hierarchy in all, and online personas are no different. To say that those with skin in the game are the grifters who did not grow up online would be foolish. The upper caste the technocrats of the wired are those who were wired since their formative years.

This is precisely why these old grifters don't get it. They grew up their life, used the internet for homework, and played Xbox. Then they got Facebook, this was the first time they have ever socialised online.

These people have never lost their meat space ego, they have never even gotten close to anything close to the idea of an ego death.

Those that grow up on the internet from a young formative age, I'm speaking like 6 or 7 even earlier do not form a regular ego like that of their peers, they develop a meta-ego, they find pride in the many masks they can wear online, not just the one singular in meat space.

For these two, wired and unwired, the concept of an ego death is extremely different. For the unwired, they simply realise the limits of their own ego, they may abandon or rebuild it and go back to attaching to their new ego.

For the wired this is entirely different, usually a life of putting on different masks has lead to a complicated situation, ego death here is a killing and then merging of the online and the offline. This is true zen ego death, now easily achieved by children online.

Is this what they meant by the Indigo Children? I'm not sure but it would make sense if so.

For the Wired Children the disintegration of their meta-ego pushes them to an intrinsic almost instinctual state of Wu Wei.

This is depending on how you look at it either a state of hyper attention or hyper inattention, both at once and none at the end time.

This is how the internet is being stratified now, this is the ruminations of the next Boomer vs Zoomer divide that will be going on in 50+ years until all the Facebook denizens have died of old age.

You'll notice that the Zoomer who didn't use the internet for socialization until later in his life is a spiritual Boomer.

You'll notice the boomer who has been socialising under nicknames, personas, ids on usenet, irc, bbs, almost his entire life is a spiritual Zoomer.

I know that one day we will find that hypersocialisation under an identity or more likely identities unattached to your own meatspace avatar will be shown to drastically change the neurological make up of one's brain.

For those of you reading this who were raised online, you know this. You feel this at every interaction with these people, this isn't new to you, there have been epithets thrown at them since internet immemorial.

Those that find themselves on the outside of this meta-consciousness with only one foot in, unable to ever fully submerge are the eternal midwit, unrelated to IQ they are not intellectual midwits but midwits of the ego and of the soul.

If you are reading this and confused, you tab back to Facebook and wonder 'what if this dude talking about?' it is you my dear reader, but you will not accept that, for I am but a mad man speaking madness. It is you dear unwired that knows what the internet is all about

What can truly be trusted online lest naivete? Ideas. That is all.

If you find yourself unable to play with ideas of those with avatars or bios or typing styles you do not like, if you can hear the truth with ears wide open, but only lest it be from your clique, you are unevolved, a use not for you besides that of a boomer lolcow.

The boomer is unable to perceive of such a reality that begets;

>    “What if they're lying?”
>    “What if I'm being fooled?”

They *are* hubris. Remember that.
