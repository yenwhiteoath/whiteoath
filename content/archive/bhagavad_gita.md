Do thou fight for the sake of fighting, without considering happiness or distress, loss or gain, victory or defeat—and, by so doing, you shall never incur sin

Only value evenness of mind and skillful action.  Whatever else follows from this, is right

Desire for a specific result must be abandoned in battle, and in life generally

It is not those who lack energy or refrain from action, but those who work without expectation of reward who attain the goal of meditation.

Those who cannot renounce attachment to the results of their work are far from the path.

It is better to strive in one’s own dharma than to succeed in the dharma of another.
