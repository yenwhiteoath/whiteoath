### Prasangika (Consequentialist)
Methodology: reductio ad absurdum, point out that an opponent's position entails undesired consequences for the opponent himself.
- Buddhapalita
- Candrakirti
- Santideva

### Svatantrika (Autonomist)
Believe reductio ad absurdum is not enough, autonomous inference should be employed to put forth one's own positions. Tsong kha pa says that Svatantrikas, although they deny svabhava ultimately like the Prasangikas, accept that in the conventional realm there is conventional svabhava.
- Sautrantika-Svatantrika
  - Bhavaviveka
- Yogacara-Svatantrika
  - (although ultimately absolutely everything lacks svabhava, conventionally objects are not external to the reflexively aware perceiving mind)
  - Santaraksita
  - Kamalasila
