- [Inhibiting effects of theanine on caffeine stimulation evaluated by EEG in the rat](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10737183/)
  - "...Next, the stimulatory effects of caffeine were inhibited by an i.v. administration of theanine at a level higher than 5 micromol/kg (0.781 mg/kg) b.w., and the results suggested that theanine has an antagonistic effect on caffeine's stimulatory action at an almost equivalent molar concentration."
