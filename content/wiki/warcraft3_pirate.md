>I have classic WC3 installed, what should I do to not lose it to Reforged?

Don't let it update, never launch it with the Launcher, only Warcraft3.exe.

>I don't have classic WC3 installed, can I download the old client from Battle.net?

No. That client has been replaced with a 30GB version of Reforged with new graphics turned off.

>Can I just install the game from my CDs?

Yes, but the highest version you can get to offline is 1.27b. ANY non-Reforged client will immediately try to install Reforged if connected to Battle.net.

>Can I play on official Battle.net with my classic client?

No.
>I just want to play WC3 campaign for the first time. What version do I download?

Without widescreen? 1.26b
With widescreen? 1.30.1

>What are the differences in versions?

- **1.26b** is the most bug-free single-player. This version does not have official widescreen support. Unofficial widescreen mods exist but stretch the UI: https://www.hiveworkshop.com/threads/renderedge-graphic-modification-for-warcraft-iii.288375/
- **1.27b** is the latest offline version (only requires the patch file, no need to connect to Battle.net). However, 1.27a introduced the missing ambient sounds bug that didn't get resolved until 1.30.1
- **1.29.2** is a relatively bug-free single-player with widescreen support. 1.29.1 is also passable but has more bugs. Check the patch notes to see if you mind.
- **1.30.1** and on fix the ambient sounds issue. This is also the version supported by WC3Connect if you ever want to play online multiplayer including custom maps in a Battle.net-like environment, but outside Blizzard's official Battle.net
- **1.31.1** is the latest pre-Reforged version. This version added a lot of modding/world editor updates like LUA support.
PTR builds do not support LAN play
