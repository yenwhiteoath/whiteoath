Ray Peat explained the "people being unable to visualize an apple in their mind" thing like 20 years ago, it's not innate, it comes due to an excess of serotonin. On the "personality"/"consciousness" level, serotonin promotes excessive speech and wordiness and a lack of imagery.

If your serotonin is too high, your dreams become less vivid, some people's dreams even end up consisting of "narration" with no visions. This is why cyproheptadine, which blocks serotonin, leads to very vivid dreams. Serotonin is inescapable stress, inhibition of life, regress.

No one is born soulless, but a lack of love, stress, feeling lost, bad nutrition, etc. suppress one's capacity of forging beautiful visions. The organism has not enough energy to support such complicated functions and collapses into simple words. Also why SSRIs make life "gray".

As all of us are metabolically suppressed today, even those who can "see the apple in color" still experience an image that, compared of the high vividness of optimal possibility, is boring, foggy, faint, etc. We will all see brighter colors again, one day.

Also if you have a lack of imagination/non-vivid dreams/high verbality, etc. AND any "autoimmune" disease you're probably in severe serotonin excess and cyproheptadine should be a magic bullet solution to the illness.

High serotonin is maybe also why women like to babble so much

I think high estrogen goes with the oververbalization, serotonin tends to make you withdraw, but as the go hand in hand you are more likely to sperg out or be completely mute. An either or situation

The case for these psychedelics is that they are dose dependant, they act on serotoninergic nerves more than direct serotonin levels in the brain (depends on drug tho)
And with MDMA it also ups dopamine to a large extent

"First generation" antihistamines will help such as benadryl and cyproheptadine, salt, sugar and calcium are good right before bedtime and maybe also eating a raw carrot at noon

Estrogen is not the female hormone, and when androgens are high estrogen tends to go with it (this is what roid rage is btw) almost anything I'd reversible, but the deeper you dig yourself the harder it can be to get out of it
It comes down to s few things like a lack of dopamine

I don't think melatonin is the sleep hormone as much as it is a darkness protection hormone, all the downstream metabolites of tryptophan and serotonin seem to be connected with shock, stress and death

Nah that's high dose, when you start to hallucinate it's high serotonin, works different depending on dosage, like for example benadryl lowers serotonin in low dosage, but increases it at high dosage

The pineal gland is the death gland, like cortisol, estrogen, adrenaline is produced under stress, the last in line is DMT and other downstream derivatives of tryptophan, serotonin ect.

>Stress hormones, serotonin, turn people criminal. Compulsive violent urges are not "masculine" at all, they're a sign that there's something going wrong inside you. Finding wife-beating hot (e.g. that "you hit like a bitch" tweet) is the same - your body's fucked up

High androgens either endogenous or exogenous often go together with increased estrogen, mainly because of aromatization. This is roid rage in all it's simplicity

Wanting to rape and kill everyone you see isn't a "HIGH T trait" in the sense that Thyroid, progesterone, dhea ECT can be low while estrogen and serotonin is very high and testosterone happens to be high (perhaps from not converting into DHT ECT)

High androgens balanced with a background of the brain protective hormones will make you calm, confident and grounded. Not insane wanting to fight/fuck
The "high T/low T" meme is an oversimplification to the point that the general picture of what whoremoans are loses all meaning
