Someone may ask the reasons why I was led to write this treatise. I
reply: there are eight reasons.
The first and the main reason is to cause men to free themselves
from all sufferings and to gain the final bliss; it is not that I desire
worldly fame, material profit, or respect and honor.
The second reason is that I wish to interpret the fundamental mean-
ing [of the teachings] of the Tath1gata so that men may understand
them correctly and not be mistaken about them.

(“Tathagata” in this context is used as one of the epithets of Buddha,
the Awakened One, and is usually interpreted as “Thus come,”
“Thus gone,” or by some as “He who has come from the Truth or
Absolute.”)

The third reason is to enable those whose capacity for goodness has
attained maturity to keep firm hold upon an unretrogressive faith in the
teachings of Mahayana.
The fourth reason is to encourage those whose capacity for good-
ness is still slight to cultivate the faithful mind.
The fifth reason is to show them expedient means (upaya) by which
they may wipe away the hindrance of evil karma, guard their minds
well, free themselves from stupidity and arrogance, and escape from
the net of heresy.
The sixth reason is to reveal to them the practice [of two methods
of meditation], cessation [of illusions] and clear observation (samatha
and vipasyana; Ch., zhiguan), so that ordinary men and the followers
of Hinayana may cure their minds of error.
The seventh reason is to explain to them the expedient means of
single-minded meditation (smriti ) so that they may be born in the pres-
ence of the Buddha and keep their minds fixed in an unretrogressive
faith.
The eighth reason is to point out to them the advantages [of study-
ing this treatise] and to encourage them to make an effort [to attain
enlightenment]. These are the reasons for which I write this treatise.

Question: What need is there to repeat the explanation of the teach-
ing when it is presented in detail in the sutras?
Answer: Though this teaching is presented in the sutras, the capac-
ity and the deeds of men today are no longer the same, nor are the con-
ditions of their acceptance and comprehension. That is to say, in the
days when the Tath1gata was in the world, people were of high apti-
tude and the Preacher excelled in his form, mind, and deeds, so that
once he had preached with his perfect voice, different types of people
all equally understood; hence, there was no need for this kind of dis-
course. But after the passing away of the Tathagata, there were some
who were able by their own power to listen extensively to others and
to reach understanding; there were some who by their own power
could listen to very little and yet understand much; there were some
who, without any mental power of their own, depended upon the ex-
tensive discourses of others to obtain understanding; and naturally
there were some who looked upon the wordiness of extensive dis-
courses as troublesome, and who sought after what was comprehen-
sive, terse, and yet contained much meaning, and then were able to un-
derstand it. Thus, this discourse is designed to embrace, in a general
way, the limitless meaning of the vast and profound teaching of the
Tathagata. This discourse, therefore, should be presented.

===============================================================================

The Mind in terms of the Absolute is the one World of Reality (dharma-
dh1tu) and the essence of all phases of existence in their totality.

(Fazang says of the phrase “in their totality”: “Because the two as-
pects of One Mind, i.e., the Absolute aspect and the phenomenal
aspect, are not differentiated, but include each other, the words ‘in
their totality’ are used. The one World of Reality is nothing but the
world of samsara. At the same time the world of samsara is nothing
but the world of the Absolute. In order to indicate these meanings,
the Essence which is the same in both aspects is mentioned.”)

That which is called “the essential nature of the Mind” is unborn
and is imperishable. It is only through illusions that all things come to
be differentiated. If one is freed from illusions, then to him there will
be no appearances (lakshana) of objects [regarded as absolutely inde-
pendent existences]; therefore all things from the beginning transcend
all forms of verbalization, description, and conceptualization and are,
in the final analysis, undifferentiated, free from alteration, and inde-
structible. They are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness.
All explanations by words are provisional and without validity, for
they are merely used in accordance with illusions and are incapable [of
denoting Suchness]. The term Suchness likewise has no attributes
[which can be verbally specified]. The term Suchness is, so to speak,
the limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to
words. But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to, for
all things [in their Absolute aspect] are real; nor is there anything
which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the
state of Suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable
of being verbally explained or thought of; hence, the name Suchness.

(“Unborn” (an-utpanna) is a technical term used in the sense of “be-
yond time determination.” For further discussion on “Unborn,” cf.
translation, pp. 77– 78.
The statement that the Absolute transcends all modes of thought
is constantly repeated in the Buddhist scriptures and commentaries.
The ideas expressed in the preceding several lines are found in terse
presentation in the following passage by N1g1rjuna: “While the
object of thought is absent predication ceases; for, just as in the case
of nirvana, the essential nature of all things (dharmata-dharma-
svabhava), which is neither born nor perishes, cannot be predicated.”
In regard to the sentence “The term Suchness is, so to speak, the
limit of verbalization wherein a word is used to put an end to
words,” a Korean monk, Wonhyo, in his commentary on this text
written in the early part of the eighth century says: “It is just as
though one stops the voices with a voice.” Following this comment
by Wonhyo, Fazang explains: “It is just like saying ‘Be quiet!’ If this
voice were not there, other voices would not be made to cease.”
The term Suchness (tathata) is symbolic. It is an index to that
which is transcendental; it is a provisional device of language on the
conceptual plane used in an attempt to establish some sort of com-
munication in a realm where all verbal communication fails.)

Question: If such is the meaning [of the principle of Mahayana],
how is it possible for men to conform themselves to and enter into it?
Answer: If they understand that, concerning all things, though they
are spoken of, there is neither that which speaks nor that which can be
spoken of, and though they are thought of, there is neither that which
thinks nor that which can be thought of, then they are said to have con-
formed to it. And when they are freed from their thoughts, they are
said to have entered into it.
Next, Suchness has two aspects if predicated in words. One is that
it is truly empty (sunya), for [this aspect] can, in the final sense, reveal
what is real. The other is that it is truly nonempty (a-sunya), for its
essence itself is endowed with undefiled and excellent qualities.

(To paraphrase in more familiar terms, “sunya-approach” may be
replaced by “negative approach” which rejects any affirmative iden-
tification of the Absolute with any mode of thought; and “a-sunya-
approach” by “positive approach” which affirms the Absolute by
means of its attributes and influences. The two approaches are re-
garded in the text as complementary.)

===============================================================================

Purity of Wisdom. By virtue of the permeation (vasyana, per-
fuming) of the influence of dharma [i.e., the essence of Mind or orig-
inal enlightenment], a man comes to truly discipline himself and fulfills
all expedient means [of unfolding enlightenment]; as a result, he breaks
through the compound consciousness [i.e., the Storehouse Conscious-
ness that contains both enlightenment and nonenlightenment], puts an
end to the manifestation of the stream of [deluded] mind, and mani-
fests the Dharmak1ya [i.e., the essence of Mind], for his wisdom
(prajña) becomes genuine and pure.
What is the meaning of this? All modes (lakshana) of mind and
consciousness [under the state of nonenlightenment] are [the products
of ] ignorance. Ignorance does not exist apart from enlightenment;
therefore, it cannot be destroyed [because one cannot destroy some-
thing that does not really exist], and yet it cannot not be destroyed [in-
sofar as it remains]. This is like the relationship that exists between the
water of the ocean [i.e., enlightenment] and its waves [i.e., modes of
mind] stirred by the wind [i.e., ignorance]. Water and wind are insep-
arable; but water is not mobile by nature, and if the wind stops the
movement ceases. But the wet nature remains undestroyed. Likewise,
man’s Mind, pure in its own nature, is stirred by the wind of ignorance.
Both Mind and ignorance have no particular forms of their own, and
they are inseparable. Yet Mind is not mobile by nature, and if igno-
rance ceases, then the continuity [of deluded activities] ceases. But the
essential nature of wisdom [i.e., the essence of Mind, like the wet na-
ture of the water] remains undestroyed.

===============================================================================

Question: If the mind ceases to be, what will become of its con-
tinuity? If there is continuity of mind, how can you explain its final
cessation?

Answer: What we speak of as “cessation” is the cessation of the
marks of [the deluded] mind only and not the cessation of its essence.
It is like the case of the wind that, following the surface of the water,
leaves the marks of its movement. If the water should cease to be, then
the marks of the wind would be nullified and the wind would have no
support [on which to display its movement]. But since the water does
not cease to be, the marks of the wind may continue. Because only the
wind ceases, the marks of its movement cease accordingly. This is not
the cessation of water. So it is with ignorance; on the ground of the
essence of Mind there is movement. If the essence of Mind were to
cease, then people would be nullified and they would have no support.
But since the essence does not cease to be, the mind may continue.
Because only stupidity ceases to be, the marks of the [stupidity of the]
mind cease accordingly. It is not that the wisdom [i.e., the essence] of Mind ceases.

(This simile, well known for its occurrence in this text, has been pop-
ular among the Buddhist thinkers in the Far East as one of the best
means to explain the relationship that exists between phenomena
and the Absolute.)

===============================================================================

Question: How should he practice cessation and clear observation?
Answer: What is called “cessation” means to put a stop to all charac-
teristics (lakshana) of the world [of sense objects and of the mind], be-
cause it means to follow the éamatha (tranquility) method of meditation.
What is called “clear observation” means to perceive distinctly the char-
acteristics of the causally conditioned phenomena (saÅs1ra), because it
means to follow the vipaéyan1 (discerning) method of meditation.

Question: How should he follow these?
Answer: He should step by step practice these two aspects and not
separate one from the other, for only then will both be perfected.
These two methods of meditation, i.e., éamatha (Ch., zhi ) vipaéyan1
(Ch., guan) singly and also as a pair, appear in the scriptures of old
P1li sources. Much discussion of them is to be found in the s[tras and
commentaries. Explanations differ, but the basic notion that éamatha
implies “tranquilization, stabilization, cessation, etc.,” and that vipaé-
yan1 implies “discerning, clear observation, distinct perception,
etc.” remains unchallenged. The most elaborate descriptions of them
are to be found in the Tiantai school of Buddhism in China. 48

the practice of cessation
Should there be a man who desires to practice “cessation,” he should
stay in a quiet place and sit erect in an even temper. [His attention
should be focused] neither on breathing nor on any form or color, nor
on empty space, earth, water, fire, wind, nor even on what has been
seen, heard, remembered, or conceived. All thoughts, as soon as they
are conjured up, are to be discarded, and even the thought of discard-
ing them is to be put away, for all things are essentially [in the state of ]
transcending thoughts, and are not to be created from moment to mo-
ment nor to be extinguished from moment to moment; [thus one is to
conform to the essential nature of Reality (dharmat1) through this
practice of cessation]. 49 And it is not that he should first meditate on
the objects of the senses in the external world and then negate them
with his mind, the mind that has meditated on them. If the mind wan-
ders away, it should be brought back and fixed in “correct thought.” It
should be understood that this “correct thought” is [the thought that]
whatever is, is mind only and that there is no external world of objects
[as conceived]; even this mind is devoid of any marks of its own
[which would indicate its substantiality] and therefore is not substan-
tially conceivable as such at any moment. 50
Even if he arises from his sitting position and engages in other ac-
tivities, such as going, coming, advancing, or standing still, he should
at all times be mindful [of the application] of expedient means [of per-
fecting “cessation”], conform [to the immobile principle of the essen-
tial nature of Reality], 51 and observe and examine [the resulting expe-
riences]. When this discipline is well mastered after a long period of
practice, [the ideations of ] his mind will be arrested. Because of this,
his power of executing “cessation” will gradually be intensified and
become highly effective, so that he will conform himself to, and be able
to be absorbed into, the “concentration (sam1dhi) of Suchness.” Then
his defilements, deep though they may be, will be suppressed and his
faith strengthened; he will quickly attain the state in which there will
be no retrogression. But those who are skeptical, who lack faith, who
speak ill [of the teaching of the Buddha], who have committed grave
sins, who are hindered by their evil karma, or who are arrogant or in-
dolent are to be excluded; these people are incapable of being absorbed
into [the sam1dhi of Suchness].
Next, as a result of this sam1dhi, a man realizes the oneness of the
World of Reality (dharmadh1tu), i.e., the sameness everywhere and
nonduality of the Dharmak1ya of all the buddhas and the bodies of
sentient beings. This is called “the sam1dhi of one movement.” 52 It
should be understood that [the sam1dhi of ] Suchness is the foundation
of [all other] sam1dhi. If a man keeps practicing it, then he will grad-
ually be able to develop countless other kinds of sam1dhi.
If there is a man who lacks the capacity for goodness, he will be
confused by the evil Tempter, by heretics and by demons. Sometimes
these beings will appear in dreadful forms while he is sitting in medi-
tation, and at other times they will manifest themselves in the shapes
of handsome men and women. [In such a case] he should meditate on
[the principle of ] “mind only,” and then these objects will vanish and
will not trouble him any longer. Sometimes they may appear as the im-
ages of heavenly beings or bodhisattvas, and assume also the figure
of the Tath1gata, furnished with all the major and minor marks; or
they may expound the spells or preach charity, the precepts, patience,
zeal, meditation, and wisdom; or they may discourse on how the true
nirv1âa is the state of universal emptiness, of the nonexistence of
characteristics, vows, hatreds, affections, causes, and effects; and of
absolute nothingness. They may also teach him the knowledge of his
own past and future states of existence, the method of reading other
men’s minds, and perfect mastery of speech, causing him to be cov-
etous and attached to worldly fame and profit; or they may cause him
to be frequently moved to joy and anger and thus to have unsteadiness
of character, being at times very kindhearted, very drowsy, very ill, or
lazy-minded; or at other times becoming suddenly zealous, and then
afterward lapsing into negligence; or developing a lack of faith, a great
deal of doubt, and a great deal of anxiety; or abandoning his funda-
mental excellent practices [toward religious perfection] and devoting
himself to miscellaneous religious acts, or being attached to worldly
affairs that involve him in many ways; or sometimes they may cause
him to experience a certain semblance of various kinds of sam1dhi,
which are all the attainments of heretics and are not the true sam1dhi;
or sometimes they may cause him to remain in sam1dhi for one, two,
three, or up to seven days, feeling comfort in his body and joy in his
mind, being neither hungry nor thirsty, partaking of natural, fragrant,
and delicious drinks and foods, which induce him to increase his at-
tachment to them; or at other times they may cause him to eat without
any restraint, now a great deal, now only a little, so that the color of
his face changes accordingly.
For these reasons, he who practices [“cessation”] should be discreet
and observant, lest his mind fall into the net of evil [doctrine]. He
should be diligent in abiding in “correct thought,” neither grasping
nor attaching himself to [anything]; if he does so, he will be able to
keep himself far away from the hindrance of these evil influences.
He should know that the sam1dhi of the heretics are not free from
perverse views, craving, and arrogance, for the heretics are covetously
attached to fame, profit, and the respect of the world. The sam1dhi of
Suchness is the sam1dhi in which one is not arrested by the activity
of viewing [a subject] nor by the experiencing of objects [in the midst of
meditation]; even after concentration one will be neither indolent nor
arrogant and one ’s defilements will gradually decrease. There has
never been a case in which an ordinary man, without having practiced
this sam1dhi, was still able to join the group that is entitled to become
Tath1gatas. Those who practice the various types of dhy1na (medita-
tion) and sam1dhi that are popular in the world will develop much at-
tachment to their flavors and will be bound to the triple world because
of their perverse view that 1tman is real. They are therefore the same
as heretics, for as they depart from the protection of their good spiri-
tual friends, they turn to heretical views.
Next, he who practices this sam1dhi diligently and wholeheartedly
will gain ten kinds of advantages in this life. First, he will always be
protected by the buddhas and the bodhisattvas of the ten directions.
Second, he will not be frightened by the Tempter and his evil demons.
Third, he will not be deluded or confused by the ninety-five kinds of
heretics 53 and wicked spirits. Fourth, he will keep himself far away from
slanders of the profound teaching [of the Buddha] and will gradually
diminish the hindrances derived from grave sins. Fifth, he will destroy
all doubts and wrong views on enlightenment. Sixth, his faith in the
Realm of the Tath1gata will grow. Seventh, he will be free from sorrow
and remorse and in the midst of saÅs1ra will be full of vigor and un-
daunted. Eighth, having a gentle heart and forsaking arrogance, he
will not be vexed by others. Ninth, even if he has not yet experienced
sam1dhi, he will be able to decrease his defilements in all places and at
all times, and he will not take pleasure in the world. Tenth, if he expe-
riences sam1dhi, he will not be startled by any sound from without.
Now, if he practices “cessation” only, then his mind will be sunk [in
self-complacency] and he will be slothful; he will not delight in per-
forming good acts but will keep himself far away from the exercise of
great compassion. It is, therefore, necessary to practice “clear obser-
vation” [as well].

the practice of clear observation
He who practices “clear observation” should observe that all condi-
tioned phenomena in the world are unstationary and are subject to in-
stantaneous transformation and destruction; that all activities of the
mind arise and are extinguished from moment to moment; and that,
therefore, all of these induce suffering. He should observe that all that
had been conceived in the past was as hazy as a dream, that all that is
being conceived in the present is like a flash of lightning, and that all
that will be conceived in the future will be like clouds that rise up sud-
denly. He should also observe that the physical existences of all living
beings in the world are impure and that among these various filthy
things there is not a single one that can be sought after with joy.
He should reflect in the following way: all living beings, from the
beginningless beginning, because they are permeated by ignorance,
have allowed their mind to remain in saÅs1ra; they have already suf-
fered all the great miseries of the body and mind, they are at present
under incalculable pressure and constraint, and their sufferings in the
future will likewise be limitless. These sufferings are difficult to for-
sake, difficult to shake off, and yet these beings are unaware [that they
are in such a state]; for this, they are greatly to be pitied.
After reflecting in this way, he should pluck up his courage and
make a great vow to this effect: may my mind be free from discrimina-
tions so that I may practice all of the various meritorious acts every-
where in the ten directions; may I, to the end of the future, by apply-
ing limitless expedient means, help all suffering sentient beings so that
they may obtain the bliss of nirv1âa, the ultimate goal.
Having made such a vow, he must, in accordance with his capacity
and without faltering, practice every kind of good at all times and at all
places and not be slothful in his mind. Except when he sits in concen-
tration in the practice of “cessation,” he should at all times reflect upon
what should be done and what should not be done.
Whether walking, standing, sitting, lying, or rising, he should prac-
tice both “cessation” and “clear observation” side by side. That is to
say, he is to meditate upon the fact that things are unborn in their es-
sential nature; but at the same time he is to meditate upon the fact that
good and evil karma, produced by the combination of the primary
cause and the coordinating causes, and the retributions [of karma] in
terms of pleasure, pain, etc., are neither lost nor destroyed. Though he
is to meditate on the retribution of good and evil karma produced by
the primary and coordinating causes [i.e., he is to practice “clear obser-
vation”], he is also to meditate on the fact that the essential nature [of
things] is unobtainable [by intellectual analysis]. The practice of “ces-
sation” will enable ordinary men to cure themselves of their attach-
ments to the world, and will enable the followers of the HEnay1na to
forsake their views, which derive from cowardice. The practice of “clear
observation” will cure the followers of the HEnay1na of the fault of hav-
ing narrow and inferior minds that bring forth no great compassion, and
will free ordinary men from their failure to cultivate the capacity for
goodness. For these reasons, both “cessation” and “clear observation”
are complementary and inseparable. If the two are not practiced to-
gether, then one cannot enter the path to enlightenment.
Next, suppose there is a man who learns this teaching for the first
time and wishes to seek the correct faith but lacks courage and
strength. Because he lives in this world of suffering, he fears that he
will not always be able to meet the buddhas and honor them person-
ally, and that, faith being difficult to perfect, he will be inclined to fall
back. He should know that the Tath1gatas have an excellent expedient
means by which they can protect his faith: that is, through the strength
of wholehearted meditation on the Buddha, he will in fulfillment of his
wishes be able to be born in the Buddhaland beyond, to see the Buddha
always, and to be forever separated from the evil states of existence. It
is as the s[tra says: “If a man meditates wholly on Amit1bha Buddha
in the world of the Western Paradise and wishes to be born in that
world, directing all the goodness he has cultivated [toward that goal],
then he will be born there.” 54 Because he will see the Buddha at all
times, he will never fall back. If he meditates on the Dharmak1ya, the
Suchness of the Buddha, and with diligence keeps practicing [the med-
itation], he will be able to be born there in the end because he abides in
the correct sam1dhi. 55
