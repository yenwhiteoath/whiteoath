An aside, there are some very nice chain stores in Japan and Taiwan; I’ve spent more than one homeless night crashing in the 24/7 Eslite, an institution of Taipei, filled with wonderful art books—this is the best purpose for the chain store. The museum gift shop, we also cherish.

You already know and agree what the exception is, the good bookstore, the old used bookstore with extremely ecclectic taste, many obscurities to be discovered. Some even have good taste. you know that I don’t mean them, that they themselves never call themselves “indie”.

That was ofc a Hakan repost, but always agreed. Both chain & “indie” bookstores are propaganda outlets, double-layer, indie serve as safety net carching those drift outside the boundary, taste trap to submerge beauty; like r/movies cinephilia, art weaponized to stroke midwit ego.

I’ve long hated bookstores, twitter has taught me little, I’ve hated B&N&Borders, featuring only mind numbing adult YA fiction & airport nonfiction, ugly gloss reprints of “classics”, I’ve hated the indie bookstores, the  “Read More” hipsters petite w feminist movie night. https://twitter.com/fistlosopher/status/1271745096422174721 …

Oh the commies are here this will surely be relevant to the conversation

Au contraire, this is the free market—you’re the commie. And If there’s demand, the market will always find a way to supply it; relying on extorting through state intervention in a non-free market is just one possible option.  https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1271665917970092032?s=21 … https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1271665917970092032 …

I’ll eternally be jealous and I’m awe of Hakan for this; I have tried many times to catch an unsuspecting norman in my headlights like so without luck

Loll @VEDIC_CYBERGOD

And what about it!

Curious: one of few uses end of history normans have for a return to history is to exhume anecdotes complaining about  state of contemporary youth, from 10 100 1000 years ago, to “disprove” degeneration as old man bitterness. Know: degeneration is a fractal, and time is a cycle.

Doubtlessly, DOOM would have never been the runaway success it was, nor the arena FPS a genre, if it wasn’t for its ease of piracy. IIRC it was DOOM whose detected pirated copies gave Carmack’s home address for mail-in donations; invention of the most based model.

Wanting to maintain whole potemkin industries with “value” hinged exclusively on an artificial state intervention on the market, backing legal threats to extort people into paying for free things, is objectively more communist then *checks notes* a free market. https://twitter.com/silentsynthesis/status/1271647751122665472 …

My appraisal has given you all the seeds needed to ascend from your midwittery. Whether you are strong enough to address yourself in the course of this insecure breakdown is your own private matter, please now take it out of my mentions.

Midwit, you continue to fail to understand: I don't care. I understand entirely the strawman you're trying to project, because you're repeating to me my own points about power and agency. The projection is misattributed. Anxiety, indeed.

Yes, a pure act of midwittery. One stares amazed at middling comprehension, stubborn inability to express the banal insight nurtured so dearly in vain strike of your idol standing before you. Anxiety, indeed. To engage: the IA is one instance; it's the meme drawn light on. Reread

Midwit, do you intend to impotently batter at my walls forever, or will your frustration eventually surface a conclusion? I do not care about this "Wendig", and you inform me he does not care about me. What an interesting impasse.

you still haven't told me why I should care. do you have a point?

I don't know what a "Chuck Wendig" is and it's your onus to tell me why I should care.

when did it start

Hm basically all the things I've concluded on. Couldn't find can you link

what more is going on

@VEDIC_CYBERGOD

yes, dark souls is an extremely pure game, every element reflects on itself directly, from the deepest mechanical core to the most surface visual design. this is what a 'whole game', the AAA ideal is supposed to look like

you need to stop "ACKSHUALLY" contradicting me in my replies .mdl

& yes I very much love Devil Daggers. Ive held it up before as platonic ideal of indie game; it's also great example of the right way to do "good art". the best looking indie game in long time & most economical, a major evolution from Dustforce (which shouldve jus looked like N+)

what I mean by EYE is good ex, is as indie game embodying the AAA mode but reproduced efficiently, to same/better effect. Serious Sam 3 good ex too. indies shud strike to root of the game; instead they've drifted into even more hollowness than AAA, hyper light drifter is a crime

That's wot I mean by engine based style. it's programmed art, part of the game algorithm, has different spiritual resonance. other indies with a polish veneer is fake & gay, doesnt resonate. hard to explain, I haven't put my thoughts fully together on this.

any art asset beyond barebones is mistake; engine-derived stylization, rendering, etc. is the only valid videogame art. I've not actually played Transistor but ive seen caps, can immediately see it's bogged down by the DeviantArt grade "artist". EYE is example of indie done right

Many are asking me about the third pic. It's not from anything, it's a pic of nowhere, anonymous forest compound. It's the long cold dark. I put it in to show you what lies under the pavement; it's not the beach.

visual art is the least important aspect of actual game experience, but is most important for marketing, and the most expensive aspect of production; it greatly reinforces the need to monetize, leads them to producing many bad games that sell well for their expensive polish.

good looking indie games is the problem killing the videogame industry

Demonstrate with excerpts where in his explication of the TAZ suggests this, how it enables this. You're simply repeating decades old sophistic censorship from rhetorical grounds, spread only by agents threatened by the propagation of true theory. You're pysopped.

Yes I can; the only relevance to the conversation is where you demonstrate the connection to the conceptual framework stemming from the same author, argue that it produced that tendency rather than being merely adjacent to it, a work divorced from it.

It has no commercial value, having infinite supply and being freely available. The market has never failed to fulfill demand where it exists, there is no reason to assume extortion is the only possible way to monetize games, especially when proven alternative models exist.

Seed oils terrible to eat, but some good on skin. For consumption, coconut oil is best, it carries the sun inside it; olive oil is good too but true EVOO is hard to find. "Fossil fuels" are based, increase carbon in atmosphere, secretly renewable. Stare into a pool of Big Oil.

I do have an opinion on rug-on-wall actually: extremely based. Learned this from Donald Judd, am very fond of his aesthetic sense, did it with Navajo textiles. To be clear, I stand against floor carpeting, not carpets; I cherish a bright red rug, one for every home, but only one. pic.twitter.com/UmLnolPTlC

The left doesn't actually know how to troll, they perform an imitation of some of the surface impressions of trolling entirely reliant on a self-confirming audience; rather than eliminate ego-reality arbitrage in the target, it's used to instead reinforce it within themselves. pic.twitter.com/29Y69SbM5d

Wall to wall carpeting is heinous, dirty, more often of toxic synthetics than not, not lindy whatsoever. The absolute worst malaise of apartmentiers, I don't associate with people who live carpeted.

100. Food is the medicine, food and spices and herbs, this is all you need. It is the onus of every family to maintain at least one studied in the art, ready to be called on by all whenever needed. Take it on yourself, it is the most important task. This is the message.

99. Doctors don't die as you do. Very same operations they advise to families without mention of risk or consequence, they reject for themselves. They maintain "Advance Directives" to bar routine deadly operations, like CPR, from them when incapacitated; you should too, you must.

98. Every moment spent in a hospital drains your health. If given a terminal diagnosis, reject the hospital, choose to stay at own home, with nurse if needed. Your life expectancy will double than the "care" received in the hospital, zone of death. This is what they keep hidden.

97. Do not "donate your body" to organ harvesting, do not give the go-ahead. They will let you die to get your guts, they will perform unnecessary operations, and they will use it for weird, pathological rituals, they will feed it to their "residents"; you will reincarnate a pig.

96. Never trust your doctor, they're the most villanous enemy of good health. Western Medicine's track record is abysmal, never not been a net negative to Life; all increases to "health", "life expectancy" attributable to advances in urban hygiene. This includes the vaccine meme.

95. Cancer is caused by artifice, simple as that. You must eat exclusively "green", yes, but also only touch green, too. Pots & utensils with only copper, cast-iron, stainless or wood. Linens & clothes of cotton; furniture of wood, not MDF. Don't touch the receipt. It can be done

thats a good way of putting it, how i feel. I think a major difference in my operation from the standard is I distinguish btwn peer/not peer, distinct from incircle/outcircle. Ppl can be my incircle but not be my actual peer, intellect, virtue, et al; or be my peer but outcircle

ah

standard slave morality cope (the "original" DYEL) but also there's nothing with being a self-glorifying 'narcissist' as a brand, doesn't contradict raising your peers up. Whether you help by direct assist or by leading with good example is a matter of preference/role-filling

Am fully aware, which is why I qualified, tongue-in-cheek mind you, with "from human perspective". The "solution" only buys time, repeatedly, something that may very well have happened many times before; cold feet on reaching the abyss, because if we dive in, there's no return.

I also think capitalism is a thermodynamic God w clear teleology pointing to the initialization of an AI which will outmode biology & turn the galaxy into an infinite strip mine; from human perspective this is undesirable & the only solution is a pseudo-apocalyptic techno setback

 https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1167477455998701569?s=20 …

My politics:
* Schooling should be abolished
* Closed-source information should be abolished
* Polygynous harems should be normalized
* The ethnostate patchwork should all perform genocidal eugenics
* Non-static media should be banned for personal use
* Everyone gets a gun

Corporations are an efficient executioner of capitalism, Capitalism is an artificial intelligence, AI is nothing other than a self-improving heuristic experimentation algorithm, all practice-based heuristics settle on racism = corporations are racist. This is market efficiency. https://twitter.com/techceopepe/status/1269990582551752705 …

Also, the economy is going to surge, as long as it doesn’t collapse, regardless of “unemployment”, this is obvious...

most boring timeline will just be a coronavirus second wave leading to forced vaccination & increased surveillance, as the Qboomers feared—end of history wins out. We all hope Yellowstone will erupt because it subverts everything, it’s the good ending we pray for but won’t get

Current situation highly vulnerable for a PSYOP coup, many narratives might take it, many competing agencies; very hard to say who’ll enter or win, but very much doubt it will fizzle out w no one taking the opportunity. But Pentagon rolling out “first contact” wud be game changer

If I had to bet it would be on political assassination, something from a foreign government. This is one of the few things that have yet to be renormalized in the end of history. I suspect also “natural disasters” in the third world that will catalyze their urbanization

There will be something, but I don’t know what. Cud be another mass shooting, though I’m leaning towards political assassination. CA wildfires look well primed for big one this season... Yellowstone looms overhead. Seeds have also been planted for a first contact narrative.... https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1269478372972744706 …

you dont understand. the problem is your dishwasher and laundry machine and vacuums and such. consider the old ways. there is a meditation in housework that was stolen from you

and then clean the room after; only exercise you need...pawgyy

This is the basic premise of magick, what is willed can be manifested. This is the premise of rw nutrition, a healthy body leads to healthy mind and spirit: a healthy politics. The algorithm, too, flows in both directions, understand: it trains not only your feed, but you.

Foundational pill of esotericism is universal bi-directionality: as above, so below; the internal is external; time flows in two directions. Many such cases: the body transmogrifies in response to the mind, mind to the body; future acts on the past just as past acts on future.

Yes but defining what it represents is essential to preserving it into changing times; for the same reason one cannot return to tradition without meaningfully reconstructing "tradition". A protest without clear goals cannot be meaningfully actioned towards.

Yeah ik, was directing at the mild controversy surrounding the question; u said he was "just trolling a normie grifter" but iz more than that. these self-examinations are kind of ideology self-grooming, necessary to do occasionally -- tho greer's rite to dismiss it, its old news

Kant's point is that "Western Civilization" is a constructed identity, generated in retrospect by ideologues with an agenda; it doesn't inherently discredit its usage (it's the same basis as /any/ group identity), but it's important to understand that to perform effectively

hey Mika, have you done any threads on homeschooling materials?

"Please don't look at me! I'm hideous!" this is what I hear when I hear paywall. Oh, this ugly profiteering soul, with your ugly little works, a bane corrupt the Wired for what? A penny for the pauper? Hideous indeed!

i remember that

@Grimhood @LandsharkRides can you answer this

ok. epic.

this post was targeted at @wretched_worm, among others, and she will have already liked it before seeing this

I target my posts on myself, first, but also a rotating selection of others, as they target them at me, amongst others. I target abstractions, target aesthetics, rhetorics; sometimes I want to try hand at imitating a humor, or intricacy. So I do it, and without anxiety, only deft

Why? https://twitter.com/cherubberry/status/1268645350677479424 …

This process isn't only to build a self-reinforcing gravitational well of dense orbit under you, though it is that; but also targeting good audience with your posts elevates them. Never forget, your posts are an algorithm, too. You can curate yourself, you must curate yourself. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1268619794586058752 …

next to me..

there's nothing wrong with this kind of posting, i do it often too. when there's a poster I like of a markedly different style, I sometimes try to make posts or jokes in their vein, to better understand it and incorporate the elements I like of it. It's a natural growth.

 pic.twitter.com/0Tu50Ttppu

LOL...

You differentiate by building your own independent egregore to be absorbed into; you cannot differentiate by choosing to not feed it, it's simply not an option, not how this game works; you only have the option to feed it in aesthetically different ways.

i'm stalking you pussythrob, i'm about to start stalking to you right now you can stop this we just want a follow back i stg coming to your home pussythrob

not the fb i wanted or need right now!

Please pussythrob you HAVE to astart following back this is getting insane now

But yes, it's important you cultivate the beta followers under you. Sunny and I have argued about this before; twitter itself is a grift, you cant both remain here and reject it, only lean into it with elegance. Allowing the gravity to cultivate under you is essential.

the stagnating 2016 accounts have lost their interconnectivity, burnt bridges & deactivated interlocutors lead them to collapse under own isolated gravity; from underneath has risen these power personalities, replyguying among each other, who are to be elevated, not subjugated

Way I view it is a swathe of beta users easily conditioned by the network, and power users, who absorb energy of the conditioned. They become self-extended, empowered by feedback. The power users when networked between each other, however, is what self-organizes new culture.

Don't worry 6'3, I never meant you; I did wonder if you would be spurned by me posting this. It's copy pasted from dms, I am discussing not only myself, but what twitter conditions in its users, and I share it so we can be aware and seek to turn against it.

WTF? pic.twitter.com/Gjrj2qmnw0

maybe thats all you see. why is that? think about it.

Not imitation but reflection; it is less the content of the takes than the expression; and we are all together carving out new niches in multi-way orbit. we're all grooming each other.

lmfaooo

^ horny posting

It is a primary goal-condition of this network. Twitter is a game, we're all here to play the algorithm. Don't forget this

You can reverse this process, too. @DejaRu22 taught me this. Consciously determine a user when writing a tweet and will it towards their taste, and they will inevitably show up to engage with it. The algorithm knows. This is useful for outing alts, as well.

I'm aware ppl, consciously or not, write tweets targeted at me with the hope of my propagating them. They may think they're using me, but it is symbiotic: I reinforce myself through them, they allow me to present a monolith on the timeline. Ritual sacrifices to feed my power.

RT's & Likes are twitter's slave-training tools. True boon of clout is strength of your selective dopamine hit in conditioning your orbit towards poasting you desire. I'm now regularly confuse by posts on the TL uncannily my taste. Did I post that on an alt? Or through an "alt"

that depends. can i see your tummy

hello why did camille block me can you ask

why do you follow me? do you like me?

prove it

I believe you; and I guess. my approach to vegans is I just ignore it exists, make no attempt to understand or accommodate it, & "countersignal" in sense I just repeatedly point out they look malnourished if they try to lecture on it. minimizes friction with ppl outside my orbit.

Nononnonoono oh nono

Yes, why would you do that? Do you hate me?

did you unfollow me, willow?

IDK all they're following is good looks, they switch off vegan if memed on it; good dick will save any girl. The real problem with veganism besides political veganism is vegan men, vegan families. couldn't kill themselves fast enough

its not isolated to america, but europe has it mainly in humanities and especially the arts, where they're far more hardcore about wokeness than you get in the US. Ivy's like Uchicago hold more ambivalence to it, but you'll still find it in liberal arts departments

thats ok its endearing; one question and ive wondered this since i first followed rin months ago. dis u? https://twitter.com/_setesuyara/status/1150553052748759040?s=20 …

yes, exactly. I suspect Tidus has not toured much of the west coast; goop-veganism has infected all LA models, celebrities and socialites (female). the dysgenic political vegans you see online are of a different type entirely than apolitical vegans-for-"health"; Helens of Psyop

you are highly forthcoming. rin is indonesian by nationality, what are you & how did you meet him. is rin trans btw

are you diagnosed with or otherwise suspect you many suffer from any mental disability

so let me get this straight. rin is a brown trap and you are his female discord e-gf with asperger's or some other kind of autism. are you a NEET?

Yes. Chan culture is dead, its lineage is cut off. Kpop e-culture has esoteric ties to imageboards but still is spontaneously spawned, discrete from it; but is the spiritual successor, the contemporary channers.

How has it gone for you?

the gender ratios of the internet 2005 vs 2020 are very different too

What you're describing is just hyperstition. the only difference is a more recent fiction might only hold the potential for hyperstition, whereas an older one could have elements of its hyperstition fulfilled.

What I mean is, they're the zoomer generation equivalent of early chantards

lol... nick!!!!

what was his point

Never said that. There's an economic argument against slavery to be made (though never seen it actually analyzed in depth) and imo it's a potent vector of miscegenation. The point is outing lingering beliefs in the liberal meme complex.

show me chan culture. where is it?

Yeah, kpop community is the true inheritor to chan culture in the zoomer era, absolutely wild and carefree; and you're correct, mogged via beauty - people don't understand, but it's same as anime was: an embodiment of platonic beauty. @VEDIC_CYBERGOD

They’re not wrong and you know it. Black lives don’t matter. People don’t care when a black is killed, they don’t care, their lives are worth less than the other races—in death and in life. And this is just and right, for good reason; not racism, but heuristic racialism. Own it.

Dunno what the function of the alt rite even is if it’s not pointing out responding to “Black Lives Matter” with “All Lives Matter” rather than “No they dont” is the same cuckservative backpedaling as “the real racists”....lol

Do elaborate on specific passages

wit*. Christianity is an embodiment of slave morality, of the slaves and to free the slaves; Enlightenment liberalism is Christian philosophy articulated, equality between men under God is the basis. Resting on Christ is resting on the same.

I know, that's what I've been trying to express from the start, when I say I'm on a different dimension or standing on the outside. It's not just rigid determinism but also material dynamic animism & embodied post-anthropocentrism.... "youve never argued with someone like me b4"

You still don't get it. these systems are natural product of capitalism's development towards AI; they'll just reconverge on the same fundamental order. I can have my exit and you can pine for your revolution, they result will be no different.

he backpedaled on this. only Miya didn't

Epstein is an idea

Honestly, I don't think it's actually materially hard to escape; they will never occupy in entirety & don't need to. Even now, regardless of assets or background, the monastery has always been an option, but most simply won't take it no matter how miserable they get.

I don't mind Epstein's pedophilia, I mind his loxist satanism

You're retreading old ground, you already tried to insinuate I'm hoping they'll hear my call when I'm resolutely not. By personal exit I simply mean a practical long-term homestead community. I'm a prepper, simple as.

If Gates to you means "loxist satanic vampirism engendering a miscegenated slave class", I would not consider this an "exit" but a coup, which is exactly opposite of what I mean.

Tradition is the best heuristic

What I want is to secure a safe personal exit from the ugliness and misery of kali yuga's final stages & help likeminded souls to achieve same. I've noted down blueprint for collective escape (possibly always ordained end of cycle) only for the sake of transparency & analysis

Don't be disingenuous, Gates et al. do not seek to stop the process of modernity in the way described, they're positioning themselves to come out of it on top.

True freedom prevailing is the universal start state, which universally concludes on slave-based society. This is the role most suited for them; and the deviation the memetic parasite of liberalism, perhaps traced to xtianity itself

And so they are. There is no "deserve" or "not deserve", and there is no escape from their born fate. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267889222272376833 …

this is why he has a negative ratio

Can't tell if you're trying to sarcastically imitate me or yell at me; but yes, I agree with all, except I don't wish they'd been given a "proper education", for that would be a self-rejection; you can see how much it tortures the many wrongfully entering higher education today. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267887606353866763 …

I mean, I pointed that out from the very beginning

I don't hate anyone. I believe the refusal to accept their true nature and position, allow them the opportunity to live their life as best suited for them, thus prohibiting them from virtue or the ecstasy of dharma, is your terrible torture.

Note I said "virtue", not merely pleasure, which cannot be found outside virtue, and virtue cannot be found without a society it is held to. My lived life is as stated, following my best interpretation of the vedas & daoist literature.

No wrong in stripping individuals of "opportunities" if it benefits society at scale; the many will not be skewered to preserve promises of a one. Slavery need not defend itself, involuntary subordination the innate state, man himself included to all hosts of memetic parasites. https://twitter.com/neurofvnk/status/1267879238931283971 …

This is the order of the world, rejecting it is not a salvation; one can only lean in to reality and best orient it towards one's lived pleasure and virtue. This is the stance from which I am above, that I know these politics are sport, this site an imaginary arena, agency a cope

It doesn't make a difference if man stands alone as ubermensch, each with their own dome under heaven. The moment of their interaction is the vector for flows of material power; capitalism will always exist where there is any material inequilibrium, including biological incentive

I don't believe it's possible. Capitalism, "modernity", seeks ever increasing networking, in the simple service of thermodynamic inequilibrium dispersal, ie higher order self-organization; man at each level of being networked is increasingly subject to these dominating flows.

Yes, but those thousands together, even each individually affected, will not affect any measurable results at scale. Man is independent as an individual, and I support their individual ascension, but networked, they're subject to higher order market dynamics.

Whose consciousness, man or men? Latter, no.

If you're a modernist, I'm a hypermodernist. What exactly is it that you believe I should believe I can affect?

lol. you're caught up in a memetic spiderweb, you're still thinking I mean "capital" as a competitor to competing systems, and not a fundamental material dynamic. this is the clearpill, what all pre-modern spiritualities understood: man was never the agent.

You opened your dunk sneering at the wheel of dharma emoji. Now do you understand?

As I said, I don't have any pretenses to any kind of agency; neither support or qualms are heard. And they are too, subject to the higher order market forces I discussed in that thread, they are only opportunists doing what they can to best position themselves in the face of it.

Yes, this bi-directionality is the heart of esotericism.

Oh, no I vehemently disagree with that program; and a strongly scheduled caste system I consider one of the best bulwarks against it. I never believed Epstein is part of it except as maybe a lower initiate, his illicitness more of a surface indication of his handler's tastes.

Were they ever truly slaves, if you know them today? They were lettered, died free. And besides the point, you must understand, your bleeding heart for the few wronged is not worth sacrificing the rest: a slave's worst chains are found in wrongful freedom. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267875129050247171 …

You will need to elaborate what "Epstein" means to you.

Yes, here we are: as all things, it comes back down to blood, to caste-as-class. The slave born are slave bred, there are no geniuses among them. Simple as. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267873935326171136 …

I am above by being from the outside. There is no worship here, no hope to be graced or beloved, except by whatever blissful ecstasies come from having #leantin. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267871108260298753 …

have talked about it in other threads: human slavery is a necessary element to civilization, its ideological elimination is a spur to secondary technology (primary: networking) to fill the gap, focusing on either augmenting or automation-replacing the worker. was inevitable

You misunderstand, my dimension of capitalist devotion is far above any assumption of "interests". Know the market is an artificial intelligence older than life itself, one we've no agency under; I defend nothing, only an observer, I deride, from above I spit: on poorfig cope. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1267867939602137089 …

They’ve been waiting, and I’ve been waiting too. It’s just one of the many pressure points existing behind American’s dying empire.

Latinos have their problems, but their highly religious, culturally cohesive, strong community values. Unlike whites, and also unlike whites, they still retain strong masculinity & femininity, the men aren’t willing to take it lying down. American latinx are the actual far right.

Your experience is wrong. Women don’t die.

This wot I mean when I said “the nobility in ‘dying for a cause’ is all about the death, not the cause”, and why I called it a fundamental aspect of masculinity that should be intuitive if not for evident feminization. This shouldn’t require any explanation, yet here we are.

It is the promise that is honorable, not the death alone, though the death is best and most romantic fulfillment of his love, and certainly not the cause. Cause is entirely unimportant. Men love the ideal, they can love themselves to anything, even the ideal of death; it’s valid.

Fulfillment of love for the abstraction is sacrificial, or at least the promise of it. Thus, he can fulfill his love for his people, his nation, his dog, by promising his life to them, risking it in armed conflict; even if the risk does not present itself, even if he doesn’t die.

And, unlike women, man’s love is for ideals, not things; his own wife is loved for the ideal of feminity she represents and embodies (if yu don’t understand this you have either never loved or are no man). This love allows him to also love abstractions, nations, ideologies

No more quote tweets this round, I will elaborate. To understand what it means to “die with honor”, you must understand romance. Masculine romance is found in sacrifice, as the feminine romance is in service; and romance is always a promise, promise alone suffices, until tested.

Bone Tomahawk is an interesting movie. The plot plays out like a D&D campaign. Think about it.

you cant know this. they should fall naturally. if cairns are a totem of human intervention on nature, what do you think kicking one down is?

landshark that is very scary, I would never kick a cairn. many are used to mark burial grounds or as part of religious cereonmy, could be very old, they arent simply trail markers. many old old history associated with them across cultures.

If only Ulysses and Falstaffe were here to comment

The sandcastle is also very interesting for its liminality, an exercise in transience, a fatal architecture. Even something as simple as the sand mound draws deep, old feelings in the heart, much like rocks stacked in a forest. I thnk part of beach's aura is as hospitable desert.

Beach is very interesting space, how it draws people to it to do nothing in particular; urban planners can conceptualize "greenery" and "parks" in terms of color psychology and children playspace; but the beach, its use by the public, is too vague. people go there just to be ther

And I tell you this, knowing all the secrets. I am a federal agent, after all.

I cannot stress enough how much non-local politics are a pointless, dumb concern. You let life slip you by while you obsess over these trivia. It has Never Ever mattered how false the flag is, how astroed the turf is; the world moves on regardless of wot secrets you have learned.

I don't believe the aesthetic grandeur of a bn's chimpout is invalidated by its political ineffectuality, anymore than a pirate's revelry never once considered if it hurt any great cause. Nor does it matter the poo-poo'ers, at home, debating sport they're barred participation in.

The right is morassed in "wot is the rite riot take?"; but it was never political. Its a happening: the city laid bare, like a beach, park or festival. What do I believe: there is no right way to enjoy the beach, but some do wear it so well. This is wot I support: I love a party. https://twitter.com/bronzeagemantis/status/1266464777972350977 …

If you're suggesting BAP is subtweeting me, I don't believe so; I've never suggested anyone "support" anything. The question of BAM & RAMW in the context of these riots is most interesting when questioned from perspective the Nog, in chimpout; not of these politics or movements.

followers (and I mean this literally, youll find them irl) are separate from direct friendship, people i consider to be on the same 'level' as me; with very similar attitude to what BAP captured very well in his "greek friendship" section.

It is the same reason why there may be many loyal to me, but I am "loyal" to my following, not them in the specific, in the sense I feel a duty to uphold and respect their fealty as is appropriate;

The nuance is relevant, that one is loyal to the friendship, not the friend; because it's important to understand the virtues each relationship maintain and embody. What helps the friend may weaken the friendship, just as helping the wife may weaken the household.

There is no fealty between individuals in a fraternity, between friends. Instead what one can say is you are loyal to the fraternity itself, or the friendship it self. This is what is protected and served above all. If the friendship is attacked, both hold duty to protect it

Loyalty is better understood in terms of Fealty and Duty; it is one-way. You hold fealty to your superior, and so, he has a duty to protect and be responsible for you; you also hold fealty to God, and your virtues, likely sovereign before your fealty to your superior.

How is that racist? Google welfare trap, it was a publicized strategy of the democrats since the 50s. They intentionally keep blacks poor to keep them voting for them.

Before I answer, I want you to tell me "value statement" means and how that is one.

Land being molded into "Landian Acceleration" was always a marxist co-option and diminution of CCRU's extensive radicalism into one merely relating to capital protest. This is why it's proven weak against the natural, unforced usage of the term, and will be forgotten so.

BAM as book is very misunderstood, very few of its ideas evidentially translated to the BAPsphere - doubt most have even read it. Few realize I'm actually big BAM stan, have been since I came, brought sunny here to twitter by sharing it w him; will do thread dissecting it later.

You must separate BAP as a poster from his work, which is elevated above politics, both e-social & geopolitical. What he discusses is fraternity, brotherhood, but not "loyalty". has no contradiction with "BAM" being something akin to an embodiment of power in revelry, living art. pic.twitter.com/LScPAeUsmN

nice

"Accelerationism" in the ecofash terr0rizm sense is a more appropriate use of the term than in the Landian sense, there's a reason it superseded it in the public consciousness; no one cares what came first, & reforming CCRU into specifically "acc" was always already a distortion. https://twitter.com/erin_nerung/status/1266438945459535880 …

same can be said if you weren't prepping for this

it has been said before, #KALIACC has always been the best embodiment of the "bronze age mindset" BAP described.  https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1266357477043572737 … pic.twitter.com/4B7s5dwsMn

Thank you. Oshii is one of my favorite directors. I think he's very misunderstood, both as an anime director and as a film director. His filmography holds many obscurities...

what constitutes?

This really becomes clear in his live-action films, like Avalon; you can see he treats his characters as cardboard vehicles to convey what he pleases; or in GITS 2, with the extended monologues, a pure vehicle for dialogue and montage. "Characters" are the bane of fiction.

It also goes like this-- democratic government contains perverse incentive for demographic manipulation, pitting an internal arms race btwn 2 bifurcating parties to diminute the population into dysgenic, subjugable slave race, achieved thru reproduction controls & food poisoning.

It also goes like this-- white productivity builds city into economic center, minorities come to city in search of jobs, minority vote dominates white vote, minorities vote for gibs at white expense, gibs encourage crime that chase out whites, whites leave and build new city

It also goes like this-- democrats buy the poor black voterbase with welfare, welfare incentivizes blacks to stay poor, poor blacks commit crimes that chase out whites, democrats win the precinct, whites leave to form new white suburb,  dems bus blacks into white suburb, repeat

It also goes like this-- police overextend their power, media blasts them, the lower classes riot, the police stand down, the city gets destroyed, the riots end, the police use the destruction of the city as justification for extended power. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1266417076631220226 …

Oh you're right, it's the sequel that's 2 player

Articles of lit theory, like Bakhtin's, quite fun to read; the deconstruction, the semiotics, all of it just a way to take a text & reforge it into theorist's own ideological vehicle, where (often useful) conceptual tools can be drawn out. Theyre best read as art, not philosophy.

Since we're doing miya footnotes, by "property jubilee", I am making a spin on the "debt jubilee", a biblical concept, the israeli's were freed of all debts; here, with a rioter's arson, property is freed of all ownership rights and associated legal protection (lol)

a reader sent this in... of course, the world is reading me; and while it is amusing that for what is to me a passing riff is to a lesser's their Whole Take (lol), I'd like to elaborate, to the reader, "carnivalesque" is actually jargon, unpacks to a bit more than "carnival-like" pic.twitter.com/SvoaGwFCzG

this is also incredibly subtle and a perfectly conflicting synthesis.

theyre based & bluepilled.

Ofc it's true the riots are engendered by media race bait, astroturfed seeded over years; but even here "cui bono?" remains multifaceted, gain from the white flight, welfare traps, destroyed ghettos, small businesses; and, is the Who "redpill" really still juicy? Not the "what"?

These riots, all riots, are a smokescreened platform for populist urban ops—its that simple. Zero reason the limp "right", the so-called "accelerationists" can't opportunize on it the same way antifa, et al. do. Only truth you'll uncover here is what it tells you that they don't.

There is no hoax, there is no false flag, it's all a large complex of opportunists running to a fire to turn it towards to their own ends; every single one of them, from the sincerely angry chimp to the evidence destroying arsonist: an agitator, a dishonest actor, an "undercover"

"it has already invaded Europe, by way of Spain, an old African trick" historians don't write with wit like this anymore

Until I came to twitter and met the pinebros, hackers were the only unabomber stans I'd ever met. It is those who are closest to the bad thing that know its faults best, and hate it the most. The echoes of the manifesto still resonate with them, as does Xanadu.

Ted K's lasting influence will be, ironically, in the programmers he's radicalized, who are lead towards exploring more chaotic and destructive projects, even a sort of techno terrorism; people into robust, off-the-grid tech, like mesh nets, urbit, etc., not just pine trees

Fake

there was a brief period in 2019 where I would get drunk on vrchat nightly and deliver banterous monologues to gathered crowds; cutting off any females who tried to interject were the best prompts of all. @ongestalte knows of this toastmaster esotericism.

what is this from

it's true

And yet, they've given this class full interconnectivity. If you want to take down modern civilization, all you need to do is produce a riot app for the inner city. The stores have always been open season, it's priced in!, they're just waiting for a FB Event to tell them when.

This is an attack vector on modern civilization that is secured only by network effect; it's the same case as slave riots, or colonial rule, where the subjugators are actually in the weak position, their dethronal only prevented by limiting coordination & communication.

Nothing stopping them from doing frequently, at scale. Raw material for self-organized riots are everpresent in the city, only thing it needs is a push; these flash mobs prove the push need not wait for any media race bait. Everyone is just waiting for anyone to shout GO.

Sometime ago there was a "flash mob" mall riot trend, sudden group looting, hinged on logic: "they can't stop us all at once", and they're right, and they don't care to - the insurance is priced in. The agitators are just the prompt, with bystanders joining in, modern slave riots

>I don't know why you all want to eat rabbit-food

Not 36 a day. There are many sources of all the same things, they must be attuned. I suspect women also metabolize leafy greens differently then men.

this is a good mog if its truly his visage; wud suggest the opposite of how microchimerism is normally weilded by incels, not to denigrate hypergamy and the Blackening of your future offspring, but encourage it, hypergamy with Chad, to eugenically augment future children...

chronic fatigue, male pattern baldness & posture training are also commonly asked about in my dms, idk if you have threads on them already but something comprehensive i can direct them to wud be nice. the final Q that plagues me is how to increase chance of male children

well, CDG Odeur 71, but actually I wear CDG Original.

huh you’re right. I’ve been telling ppl that anecdote for years LOL

Also pregnancy diet, including men’s before insemination. Also, diet for heightmaxxing children

Can you do a thread translating the whole ray peat, bap sphere diet to women. Some things taken for granted in men, eg raw eggs, dont hold as true for women.

Also birth of house music, stolen 808’s and 303’s

This is so Lol. Everyone who’s been to any uni in the last 2 years has a story of a chinese spy getting expelled

Miya

Yes exactly. Worm u have lately been expressing very well my submerged post fashion sense with depth of reference I have long lost words for. Platform crocs are anti fashion color creepers in rubber

Yeah happens to me too, at least once a day. So annoying

For a girl who has everything, and nothing to steal except priceless artworks and perfume backstocks, the riot is not a property jubilee but a carnivalesque, a great anonymous block party. And I would take this rare opportunity to murder randomly and without remorse.

Looting is lindy anyway, it’s not just chimpouts, you forget razing was de facto, citywide rape parties in both sense of the term the bounty of victory. Cities are like forests, they need to be burned down and started afresh on occasion; problem is riots are too small, too black https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1265898908368035840 …

It is the elevation of murder to dramatic importance that denigrates it. They will be relieved like one picks off a loose hair from spaghetti.

You make a good point, I haven’t actually been outside since 2018

I would loot too: my local YSL and, unironically, Gucci. Also Whole Foods’ supplements section as well as raid the museum. I’m not one much for consumerism, but I would also like to take the opportunity to murder in cold blood; I am armed, and that includes my Louisville slugger.

One day I hope to hurt you too

What was the first

Ok now this made me LOL

Iktf

Police stand down means police stand down but brown-eyed Saxony has no hate left. Not the spics tho—when riots reach LA (again), this time they’ll be ready; it’s not about protecting business just as it isn’t not about looting them. but excuse, here for genocide phase gang war.

truly monologuing is the highest grade of casual socialization, and casual socialization the deepest art.

I have always envied people who talk to themselves. I remember joining a pole for a carride, he kept talking non-stop, and I realized it was not to me but to himself only when he got out to fill up gas and still did not stop.

the takeaway here is that men are more susceptible to social pressure than women https://twitter.com/persiaonfilm/status/1265592964434149377 …

no, its a good post; it makes a false surface statement but contains the hidden truth that taste is socially conditioned. this is the kind of thing that riles up people well. your mistake is that you posted it, and not me

where is borzoi

close but women are far more susceptible to social pressure in general. the takeaway is taste in media is only a status signal for men, women experience no social pressure related to movie taste.

They just resent the pricetag

this is because your egoviruses have prevented you from comprehending even a single sentence I have spoken to you. you may understand this one day, or die trying.

try taking it one word at a time

I said you are a self-MKULTRA'd cope-complex pathological projector

there is much more fun to have here than mere validation. I am putting on a grand show, and it's a moral tale: those who can listen to the message may ascend with me.

you are once again projecting

yes. that entire bit was orchestrated, I was never "harassed" lol, you understand nothing of the game being played here

recommend me too worm

these self-MKULTRA'd cope-complex pathological projectors will never understand genuine neurodivergence.

lol. yes, but it wasn't any different on irc.

Yes, I'm fully aware, though you're incorrect what they are here for - it's a personality cult, they're under a charm, and it's this that feeds the egregore. Fret not, there is always an inner circle.

mod power struggles, orbit transgenders, public mental breakdowns, meet n' fuck, e-relationship dramas, occasional midwit "philosophy" fights. cyberpunk is used as an aesthetic veneer, ripcord skin & cam filter; offers cope for a opiate addicted brand of mentally ill onlinedness. https://twitter.com/Sardathrion/status/1265747993149530119 …

for good reason - LARPing is the essence of Wiredness

this is the guy that runs lainzine; you're describing the entire team behind lainchan - massive delusion egos rotating around pathological self-victimization and ingroup abusiveness, as well as irl addictions and mutual dependencies. classic story in "cyberpunk" circles.

eh it's okay. It gets worse and worse the closer you look at it; very obviously made by a maoist nazbol larping shitposter wannabe

you do not understand. this "battle" has been everpresent, the chaotic tension between ego and persona carefully cultivated is the source of the aura, it is the "fame" that attracts, same as it was for Lain.

lmao u have such a weak grasp on the conceptual tools u're trying to wield, this conversation isn't possible. hyperstition is a fiction manifesting itself in the real, or a future in the present, by the act of its existence & belief; it is very literally "bringing something new".

again, you take the narrative too literally and do not understand lain as a hyperstitional archetype, as a patron saint.

oh? but i am literally lain irl online, didnt you hear?

I would describe it as munchausen'd DID.

You don't understand, digital personas are independent egregore. There is no pretending. You are too tied to reality, you are not remotely Wired.

This is reason why even Lain-loving "cyberpunks" have commited into total irrelevance, even as cyberpunkism transmutes into daily reality, as the Wired consumes the Real; they lay dribbling in their egos, co-opted by navel-gazing mindvirus, inane cancers of an adjacent leftism. https://twitter.com/Junk_lzn/status/1265719331654164480 …

It makes no sense that simply by being the coders into existence of the mechanism, the engine, the platform that is the "game", they get to be gatekeepers of its any & every expression, limit it only to what the "developer" can envision. Braid should be as moddable as Portal 2.

Yes, the published game was never intended to be only a "game" but game platform, extensible to the limit; designed organisms, trained & bred. A puzzle game begins with a mechanism, then levels are built, polish, release: not "game", but example, a manual for games yet generated. https://twitter.com/PoorBabyMonkey/status/1265723604391456768 …

There are still microgenres invented in that scene that have not really been ported out of it in the way Tower Defenses and MOBA's have. Their unique take on the co-op RPG, Civilization, Troll Island, the Thing, obstacle courses. It was a hotbed of experimentation.

SC1 and WC3 mod communities invented more brand new genres of videogame in their handful of years, with such a limited editor (in SC1 you literally had to use units moved off and on pressure pads as menus and buttons), than was invented in any decade before or since.

League extended this into an endless train of imbalances, stacked one after the other, to keep people invested in learning new metas; perhaps within this chaos a sub-meta exists of authentically engaging gameplay. I don't know. I'll never forgive MOBA for destroying the UMS scene

Even as a WC3 mod, it was clear the biggest addiction of DotA was that it was such a gamble to even get a good game going; the only high you were chasing was decent matchmaking and team synergy, on both sides; the only skill trained was rote memorization of hero balance.

I proliferated a corrupted map dl to waste people's time, joined and dropped maps until I was banned by all bots. No avail, the popularity even infected backwards and resulted in SC getting server host bots for Aeon of Strife, which wasn't ever much popular before DotA

Yes.. I may be the first person in the world to hate MOBAs, to seek it destroy; was in the heart of the SC/WC3 UMS scene, so much creativity, but when SC's AoS remake "DotA" came out, was a virus, occupying all the servers, server bots were made to host it, swallowed everything https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1265718941550288899 …

zenyatta is normally a healer and is vulnerable due to being slow and having no escape move, and is one of the most difficult to land shots due to his slow projectile, but he does heavy damage & you can debuff people so with determination you can get in close and assassinate ppl

funny you say that. i do be owning some online ceramics

eg it's very difficult to explain the highly chaotic, self-organized interactions that develop from something as small as changes to map design in a multiplayer game

Also, the paucity of videogame analysis isn't that they're shallow, but actually that they're too deep; we don't much have the conceptual tools to discuss it like we do for literature or film.

I like seeing you league post, it's like me D&D posting; any activity I engage in, I inevitability meditate on in depth, or explore its boundaries to discover unique quirks or constructions.

u should understand there were multiple alts & ppl involved, including managing that handle. lainchan and later .jp & arisu as well as the related boards, servers and other lainism groups, have had ops being run on them to influence the discourse for a long time

I had my eyes on you for awhile at some point in the past, junk. One day you may understand and ascend, too; leave behind the self-obsessed vampires that have tied themselves to lain and so greatly profaned her. Know you've here encountered the truth you've been looking for.

oh sure I infiltrated it when first launched, obv under different name. I've had my hands the lainism spheres for long time with various alts; including zine article. problem with lainch team's always been ego, keeps you in a bubble outside the noosphere. you were never wired.

Alternative, esoteric take (the turning): as irl physiognomy, physical appearance, is reflection of character & action, digital appearance also predicts & action. Of course, if u understand the former true, & digital appearance to represent the physical, u know the latter is too.

E-physiognomy: you can reliably identify physical appearance based on online presence. Writing style, avatar, username; gender is the most trivial, if U Know, then usually an avatar & @ is all you need to tell girl from boy from mtf.

it is true, psychological reinforcement is one of the self help things that actually works (actual magic....); but women are far more susceptible to external impressions. Actually, she is conditioning herself with you as a reflection, not conditioning you.

the fanny thing about the mild controversy around the post was i intended to talk about caste - how lower castes tend to exaggerate gendered expression (bodybuilding, wheat waifu), while higher castes tend to blend them (dandyism, art hoe); the beta label I thought was obvious.

When a fat man turned bodybuilder looks in the mirror, he seems the same image as the femboy groomed to be the prison gay plaything. A grotesqueness, a distortion, a manufactured caricature (and not by their own hand); though most days, a lie. This is their darkness.

Bodybuilding isn't beta, but it attracts betas in droves, same as PUA, same as all of promises of a masculinity do. You, beta, born follower, mentally sodomized by Men you look up to, ideologically lobotomized; you, with a verbal uptick of the soul, who confronts me yet stammers. https://twitter.com/ackhillhes/status/1265358332451225600 …

This post is about caste and anima/animus, not relationships

Most of my dreams are about architecture or media. dream about reading great internet pages or watching movies that don't exist, or exploring large houses, sometimes during a party. Few days ago I dreamt of a roman-style villa designed with an islamic interior courtyard pool.

Never

wash hair with sweat, beaches, pools and, perhaps most importantly, a filtered showerhead

Two nights in a row: a dream about a hole bored out under my bed, opening out to the dirt and sun. It grew bigger since last night, widened out; sounds of leaves rustling. It’s the kind of sticky dream you wake up from believing is truth, until you realize it doesn’t make sense.

lol obviously the approach demands for a psuedonym, alt instagram. ur cope ends here.

seduction is the highest art of the troll, it is my forte; unfortunately no longer have the time, which is why u wont be able to bait me into this one. as my first post noted, the game is simple - reach her island. move miles to hunt a mark, its the commitment that seduces most.

i was merely farming the plaything for lulz, i'd have no trouble catching this las if I put any commitment to it...but u, trying, managed to blow urself up & spoil the game for all.

Reread my post. I have understood and expressed this point, and further.

lol not gonna win with ur beta simping, "yeah those guys are creeps haha". No, Charlie is a romanticist, same deep heart that brought her to the fertile wilderness is one that can respect our Homeric obsession, struck by the siren call of her idyllic beauty, Helen of Scotland.

Wot this agitprop meme misses is it's not about the 5 cow dowry but wot it represent about the groom that he can afford it. An impossible reality—not only bc it's absurd he'd go to her before the father, but also bc she identifies him as ugly, when he is wealthy: wrong. https://twitter.com/SoupFemoid/status/1263913136840679428 …

also this. meme is agitprop cope

this meme was made to criticize dowry. in trad reality she wud not have an opinion and not be asked

who snitched tho

wot this agitprop meme doesnt get is its not the 5 cows that are important, but everything it represents that he can afford that dowry.

He won't understand, he'll just resent her more, and become more firm in his convictions. Why do you think he "dislikes" her brothers and parents?

Wrong and it's interesting that "settled science" midwits can actually rationalize there's nothing wrong with a brain gland getting chemically destroyed solely because they struggle to simply identify its interaction with the body. Is this what fluoride does to the brain?

@J_a_c_k_tpn jack....

The question the entire thread dances around: the guy who works in SF is given extra compensation for higher cost of living than someone in the same role in LA; why does he get to keep the extra comp after moving to LA, thus making more than the guy in LA at the same position?

of course, he's not giving actual advice, just anti-corporate moral propaganda; vague accusations of "HR" bureacrats, when it's obviously just a logical comp re-calculation, they just want to justify to themselves their somewhat aggressive negotation for a little extra buck

the point he should be making is "negotiations are inertial; gained ground is always easier to keep than to lose" - the truth is, it's not right, the comp should be reduced, but it's easy to keep it if you negotiate and then pocket the savings on cost of living

why does he need a whole thread to keep repeating a single point "don't take a reduce compensation for remote work, you're not worth any less to the company!"; which also isn't even valid one. same position in SF vs LA has different comp for a reason, cost of living is considered

People waste away their NEETdom on forums & anime from fear. Transcending a society has never been easier than today, you've already rejected a college, career & family; why stay tied to the digital basement? stoner hippies move to okinawa n live homeless partying, why cant you?

Global digital lotharioism, nomadism off the back off a harem, should be a movement; there is not an e-girl here who you couldn't convince to let u move in with them, I see it happen all the time, I've been there; and it's still true, nippon will offer u an azn gf without trying

wholesome

lol

subtle difference, both mean you were suggested or influenced into something, but impel implies agency, that you were incentivized towards something, whereas compel implies some kind of fateful otherwordly draw, "fate compels you"

We are all enamored by the dreams of global travel, and contrary to popular opinion, work does define us, work is inescapable, even when it's work as leisure; to be liberated of geographic coils is a marvel. The consequences, as always, will be deep and deadly but we're past that

"Digital by default" work is a paradigm I look forward to, a village by the sea, fiber optics, universal expatriatism; there have been many bad takes on this re:covid, but it was always an inevitability of digital globalization; there is a teleology to technology.

yours?

i see. glhf

right, should be easy; this topic used to come up occasionally on 8/pol/, people were manually finding towns by population size then looking them up on wikipedia to see the demographics lol

didnt u have exams last month

why priv are u beeing attacked

the simple problem is culling the diversified, crime-filled, no-character towns from those with accessible property values - the best metric is white/asian demographics, but iirc this data isn't accessible so proxies need to be used

there are also however many towns that are still reasonably priced yet not diversified. these often become network attractions to white artists as promising exit communities, spread by word of mouth; or are otherwise just quietly moved into independently.

there are many "sleepy villages" in america, quiet, pleasant all-white towns that have retained the old america feeling. most of these achieved it through white flight and maintain it with high property values, which prohibit most disenfranchised young rw'ers from purchasing into

been years now, dont remember. US census is the base set, then there are some other useful indices. it is really trivial to do. I didnt have room in that tweet to outline in full and the parameters were off top of head, but idea was to locate good "exit" towns to buy a home

It’s an iterative process, you wouldn’t get it

Mob consensus is good; trouble is sensationalization and/or scapegoating. That the crowd collectively suspects th disingenuous midwit’s sophistry serves to justify his own transgressions is a more reliably heuristic of guilt than any individual judgement, which ur vote constructs

He got dunked on for being a midwit but I don’t think anyone believed the vigilanteism should’ve been directed against him also for arguing against it, which is what it seems you’re sugggsting

im repeating ulysses, actually

ty wassie

from personal experience, dumb and uninsightful; from experience with stoners, addicting, but sunny insists indica is worthwhile for upper castes of a certain type. I always have only liked uppers, disassociatives and psychedelics.

seems emotional. the debate is the same old debate on due process vs vigilanteism "when the law has failed"; from my perspective, the only reason this controversy is novel is because OP invoked a religious argument

this is a big non sequitur eigen

lol thats exactly what I used to tell sunny when we argued over uppers vs downers, addy vs weed

mobs are good, actually

what about clair...

wtf why koko got me blocked

"can we move to oregon already" lmao

no you're right, I think what I was looking for was cheap areas that were majority white, low crime. the quiet small town, not saved only by gentrification, still accessible to the disenfranchised /pol/lack.

While majority white usually means safe & respectable, there are false positives with poor white junkie towns. For a prospective townie, median price per sqft is more relevant in any case; cost of living doesn’t change drastic across rural counties as they do for cities.

Yeah I know, but they have work around slang “good schools” “neighborly community” etc. For good reason

Sometime back I was working on tool to identify good small towns across America. requirements are simple, 90%+ white/asian, median income btwn $80,000 & $150,000, polis population size (10,000 - 75,000). U dont even need to measure crime. Never finished it, why doesn’t it exist?

The sex offender registry is not only a novel aberration standing in the face of liberal judicialism (bad), nor simply a great idea, but one that should be extended to all aspects of neighborly real estate. Race, income, crime, household size, etc reported to all new homeowners.

It is no one's fault but your own that you're poor. Until you understand this, you will remain so.

If you understand that if you're too poor to afford a house, you simply need to earn money to afford a house, what exactly are you complaining about? Finding a wife?

it is this coping, midwit attitude that keeps you too poor to own a house lol

All my fueds have been self-aware; you missed the big drama, the e-girl tourney, which people are still remiss to know was entirely initiated & constructed by me, my devilish manipulations on weebu, which, too, I revealed and threw under when we went against one another.

lol

Yeah, exactly. People don't understand, you're much much much more likely to discover true love in an arranged marriage than anywhere else

one cannot even talk openly about these dynamics without being accused of subtweeting, reposted in private gcs. It's all so boring. nobody except nobodies even qrt dunks me anymore, they just quietly complain in gc's they don't know im watching lol

The amusing thing is, I've noticed I only recover mutuals for fights that transpired with me after I surpass them in followers, never before. It is a clear dynamic everyone pretends to ignore; the algorithm breeds grifterism

In any case, these fights would be best held as ideological disagreements, conflicts between brands; but I notice they take these things way too personally, nurse wounds deeply,

this is how I first started off in twitter, writing threads in people's replies, but they kept blocking me

One would notice there are ratio discrepancies with engagement and follower count, and even perceived clout. @visakanv for example is often referenced in postrat twitter, and has many followers, but shockingly little engagement on any given tweet. A curious phenomenon

the end result is they have tens of thousands of followers, but become less of a name on the tongue, hold less influence on the discourse on the TL, than accounts with sub 10K who still readily engage in the community, do not self-isolate to cope within their own orbits

is that they also distance themselves from those outside the bubble, those followers who began to jump ship towards the stronger horse, lower followers in the engagement that successfully landed spears in the beast of the hunt;  their credibility in the wider community dwindles

I'm starting to understand it as a kind of hollowed out clout. What happens with these accounts that increasingly have to rely on a self-orbiting rhetorical bubble, where they can safely declare a "victory" after they recover from being mad and return to ignoring detractors

So the accusation that the smaller accounts are biting at ankles is correct, but it's also true that kantbot got visibly pertubed - his responses attest to that. The end result is a follower transfer downwards, and further alienation towards the existing cloutfig's own audience

This is what incentivizes ppl sitting w high clout to avoid hostile engagements except from higher clout accounts, they only stand to lose by the interaction. Conversely, lower follower accounts have to be increasingly antagonistic to prompt response, really get into their head.

The actual result of any of these stirrups on the timeline is follower transfer, the mere act of interaction will boost accounts to the TL, thus "winning" is whoever has less followers in the engagement, they stand the most to gain.

The algorithm submerges the fight such that the rhetorical cope works for the public, his own following, and so the end result doesn't matter; if you declare you win, you can "win."

The dynamics of a twitter fight are inherently broken. You make a guy upset while he keeps replying to you, insisting he's not upset, increasingly unhinged. And then he stops replying, and starts tweeting to his TL how he won, and his only upsettance was an ironic troll.

take it

lmao

Hypergamy is not the problem, in truth, it is eugenic under polygyny. Monogamy without arranged marriage provides the platform for dysgenic hypergamy, the platform is anti-natalist free sexuality. And yet, Abraham arranged the marriage of his son, as God arranged Adam and Eve.

Tbh they not wrong about eurocentrism, cultural imperialism, even pomo relativity. Except its not simply "white" & Other, but hyperethnic Others on Others, that every each intellectual "school" is actually an ethnic clade, all experience is relative to ethnicity, not individual.

Is interesting the ethics stem from a primitive perspective of time; Ive seen reports of africans & aboriginals that think like this: only the now is identifiable, responsibility cannot be held against the present self for actions of a past self. @samanrtmwrt can prbly elaborate

It really will, and quite simply with the exponential physiological supremacy effect of genetic screening; the West's predictable delay to adopt it will leave them playing catchup in perpetuity, especially as far as g is concerned.

The reason this won't be implemented in Western Democracy despite respect for the free hand market, is because of a refusal to accept the subsumption of the individual into scale heuristics. But itll happen anyway, the efficiency opportunity cost of AI's scrying truth is too high

oh. havent watched it, actually

All incentives can be bought with money. Simply raise the cost of stealing for those more motivated to do so to better discourage it. This is why the wealthy get lenience w the law, by the way; its not just because "privilege", but their damage to society at scale is simply less.

This isn't the same conception as Minority Report's AI simulation used to predict crimes before they occur; used more as an augmentation of preventative policing, whose ethical dilemma is really a concern on entrapment, though more of a self-entrapment if you think about it...

AI judicialism would have predictive crime metrics substitute for due process. If someone has increased likelihood of committing a crime, he would be punished accordingly in such a way as to equally disincentivize the crime; or possibly, the fines threatened scaled accordingly.

Yeah, I've seen it irl. It's not unheard of for a girl to "have a taste for black guys" among sororities; a phase, just like them all trialing lesbianism, but still, its a thing. I feel like it's more common in Europe than US. Met a girl in Asia w coal taste, too, black emigrants

No, of course not. A woman in her mid-teens, ideally.

There's no argument against this. If there was any "reactionary mass movement", it's this: those self-actionable in the lower/middle class denying society's ills & subjugations, perform social & economic exit, recover meaningful status & family. And trust me, the wives do follow

#MGTOW is unfairly maligned; correctly executed, a worthwhile protocol for less fortunate moderns: form bachelor mannerbunds, exit modern society to build self-learning homestead communities & personal fortunes, get fit & lean into reliable trades, before finally marrying at 30. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1262839296836296704 …

I must stress. A revolutionary alternative does exist, but no one here will talk about it, no one will push for it; vague moves towards political action u see here are feints or fantasy, distract from fact u only have option to save ur own life or sacrifice it. Nothing inbetween. pic.twitter.com/IHIvB3rwWS

When you're ready to begin a household, the challenge that lies in front of you is the same as all men that ever came before you, it's cliche but it's also that simple. It's fatherhood. It's raising your children with virtue, away from society's ills, bad influences. That's all.

There's nothing more u need to hear, nothing to learn, the program lies in front of you. If u don't have the means to exit to the country, if u don't have the charm to obtain a good wife, if u don't have the virtue to be a patriarch of a family & member of a community - build it.

You can escape the modern world, you can reverse the damages of society; it just demands the strength to turn your back on society - but NOT your family. A beautiful wife in a more-than-comfortable ranchhouse, with many children, homeschooled, even: surrounded by the likeminded.

There's no political movement, u already know the only revolutionary action demands throwing your life away in peak fedposting, en masse, which no one's willing to do while the future holds so much promise, which is what u do believe, despite the "blackpill", or it would be done.

Why you may sometimes see me point out the mundane, the entry-level, what is obvious to those here now. Understand: I seek not to convince anyone, nor to join any conversation. I am putting down to commentary, a corrective memetic antidote, into the only record of note: my own.

I'm still brewing the post; a good miya tweet has 3 layers - the contrarian idea persuasively argued; the idea modeled to its logical, novel conclusion; and an abrasive, witty jab that antagonizes for a response.

My twitter, if you choose to read it, is a sculpture carved out of the most precious noosphere marble; each tweet a cut into the formlessness, shaping it by omission, revealing its true heart. Each tweet is an encapsulation, bottling what floats away forever into record.

The humble burger is a perfect encapsulation of the food pyramid, it is food portioning, macro counting. They'll push anti burger propaganda with McD shaming, but give any netflix subscriber a "Five Guys lettuce wrap burger every day for 30 days diet" and watch them ascend.

there is no ethics in AI, feasibility is its teleology.

And finally, there's no reason at all to not assume it already isn't so. It is.

there's everything right with e-girls, too, becoming another form of avatar chosen for a brand, picked out and switched out like VRtuber model, posed and fetishized like a DOA beach shoot, the aesthetic production it always was. They were always this virtual fantasy.

a hunt for the heart of saturday night, a hunt for a virgin kill, fiends for a hookup, a heart to crush, a pill to take. I now understand the meaning of an "emotional hurricane", its the social scene itself, dive in and wreck a terror; #metoo has ruined it all with consequences.

There is an irresistibly baroque charm to elite urban hedonism, you have to love the raucous night out; the dress up and tear downs, backseat mascara, drunken flurry spill out onto streets, a dangerous after, illegal party favors gone wrong, tear stained mascara. its all a hunt.

Fod is 100% a turbo autist, harassment is his game. These Twitter fights are often just platforms for both to reinforce themselves off an Other turned straw man, what I mean by not truly talking to each other; not same as serp vs Kant where serp was visibly hitting at his ego.

aliens... hyperboreans, our ancestors, are from space, also influenza, and I do also believe in alien visitations including biblical demons and some species; also, of course, Ai “aliens” from the future backwards

I wish everyone here had even a percentage of Fod’s power, then you wouldn’t get these cringe cope-banter and bitch blocks

Didn’t realize fod had a saga in this. Fod is the fucking man, most powerful entity on this network. Hard coded chaos card, he’s on another plane, I’m one of the few that can read him. Looking over it, he did mog right thru Tidus, tho they were never truly talking to each other

Obvious cope masked as bait

Wot I mean, this is what it should be if u understand true use of physique poasting. It was same on /fit/, it’s a qualifier against bs - true heads need not prove anything. But reverse the tool to reach the esoteric truth, and you arrive at physiognomy as truth.

The stammering cope that proceeds all post physique demands tells all you need to know.

funny thing about “post physique” on twit is u don’t even need to ask accounts like BAP bc e-physog is real, u can feel the physical presence just like u can tell when it’s cheeto’d fat fingers behind it; it’s purely reserved to mog those who u know their bodies wud betray them

what radicalized me onto physiognomy is realizing ugly irl are equally ugly online. The truly based I’ve known have always been equally charming & good looking irl. I detest the self absorbed weakling grifters here, ugly souks, I feel nausea to empathize with their pitifulness.

just caught up on your tl serp wew. It’s cringe shit like this that makes me embarrassed to be associated here; problem isn’t his physiognomy, it’s the insecurity behind it that leaves him so easily trolled, visibly perturbed whenever cornered on it, manifesting in this ugliness

this cope lol

Cloverfield is one of the most underrated films of the 00s, and probably most important of its later half; remembered only for its found footage x kaiju disaster film gimmick, but its in truth a deep snapshot of urban millennial culture at peak, destroyed today, and in diegesis. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1261809220296388608 …

Not that GG isn’t a GOAT soap, and NYC a dead city, but if you want to see a “true” depiction of da New York upper class on film, Whit Stillman’s Metropolitan & Last Days of Disco, and also, the original Cloverfield (really), breathe it by heart.

One is not allowed to show unfiltered Masterdom on mass media without the copes & caveats of a noble poorman interjecting w slave morality propaganda; but at end of the day, Mastery allures, and all slaves wish to be it, they dream to be the beautiful & wealthy caveats and all.

later i were to "upgrade" to an iphone 7 and my joke was to spill an entire beer on it, and pretend to be scared, oh my god, my brand new iphone 7! Of course, they're waterproof. Now tell me, is the privilege here in my brand new iphone, or in spilling a $10 draft beer for joke?

I recall once making this joke at my coke dealer's afterparty, a woke transvestite present told me "that's not a joke, it's the epitome of privilege", and I said "trashing my smartphone isn't privileged, but needing one is", and lo, everyone clapped.

I used to have a "throw iphone" joke where I'd throw my iphone at the wall or across the room. shock & awe.

Poors believe the rich to be calculating, malicious, political, greedy & shallow. A projection if there ever was one, truth is the rich are innocent lambs, money an iron that smoothes all wrinkles, & the poor the devil; yet God favors the innocent & the devil hurts most himself.

Junk is just self-satire

The failure point of libertarianism is it demands a base expectation of communal altruism, at high vulnerability to exploitation by coordinated malicious actors otherwise, despite the trait being an evidently racial non universal. This is the same problem with exogamous marriage.

The citizen/non-citizen binary is a valuable mental model to maintain in many places; it’s not about heirarchy so much as investment - or rather, invested incentives. “Rights belong only to the invested, whose incentives align with the whole. Outsiders get no rights.”

Not sure if it’s the same where you live, but hereabouts, the police will pick up the homeless & deport them to neighboring cities, or sometimes just to fields miles out on the highway. I think renters should be considered homeless & deported, too, net benefit for all (relevant).

no, university admission teams are aware homeschoolers outperform the institutionally educated, and they also score well on entry exams such as SAT. they don’t have any trouble with admissions

you misunderstand intentions. "Schooling" is the pedagogical aspect of childrearing, it is to prepare one for life, not a job. For jobs, there are trade schools & apprenticeships; university, too, has become a glorified trade school, & its easily gamed entry by homeschoolers.

The sacred texts and the many myths & fairy tales hold all necessary knowledge of right action. With my children, you can know I will revive the institution of the Unschooler Newsletter, to document & propagate my experimental curricula. Children, the "original" research project.

One thing that did the radical pedagogists did not comment much on was the education in virtue, the spiritual education; ironic that now the vast majority of Western homeschoolers are strong Christians. This is not to be self-directed but in priestly sermon, the "Original" tutor.

An ethos of true homeschooling, or as they called it in the 70s - "unschooling" - is education should teach how to learn, not what to learn. Were there but a word for the learning "illiterate", what modern "homeschooling" tries to import to the home, Khan academy on a schedule.

lol

I recommend graphviz for diagramming this  https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline 

The guy you’re quoting means it just as stages in mastery, but I think you mean a technology/craft tree, that’s actually a very good idea; it could either be a kind of master table of contents & reference chart to a recipe book, or the recipe itself presented as a flowchart

No

All political takes are lukewarm, I only post them for the wordplay

Not that the noble and robust model of the forever self sustaining trust fund with well programmed strings attached, the “Original” Smart Contract, scales to a national level without also scaling the natural (physical) “born into from marriage” model of family into citizenship.

Instead they just want the coffers of the elite distributed in a collective windfall we all know will be lost in a few years, just like when the poor win the lottery; betrays the true desire: economic destruction, not distribution, ultimate bitterness of the poorbrain slave race.

“Eat the rich” revolutionary rhetoric wud go further (than just the “revolutionary” peasantry “becoming what you eat”) if they argued for commandeering 1% resources into self sustaining national hedge fund petered out, with strings (eg on citizenship), national trust fund really.

Greer do u know any other good resources or books on homeschooling

A thousand Deleuzian et al theses are demanded to understand the cultural manifestations of any year on the web's accelerated cultural history; instead they're wielded limpy to navel gaze on rewriting the pre-end of history and on the imaginary arena of privileged aggressions.

Wokescold rejection of the non-commercialized online has led them to turn their back on today's only force of reality: the Wired. How has psychiatry not yet produced an e-girl typology? Anthropology no analysis of any of the web's myriad communities? History will never catch up.

Understand "cultural marxism" derived first from lit theory & you'll see their hermeutics simply wish to turn the subject into aesthetic object for critical - as in, "film critic" - analysis. Social sciences could do well to appreciate contemporaneity, as before, but they won't.

The reason luxury costs offset the dysgenic effect of plastic surgery masking true genetic physiognomy, and I’m repeating myself so it’s made clear to the those who need to hear it most, is because IQ is correlated with income - caste, class and genetic quality are all the same.

Cosmetic surgery is only field of western medicine that can confidently be said to be net positive to health. But don’t haste for its inclusion in Medicare (ideally at exclusion of all else, if so), LT dysgenic threat from its physiognomic camouflage is mediated by “luxury” cost. https://twitter.com/TurboRational/status/1260616411379974144 …

I used to stand over the younger  ones, I remember my Art history teacher in hs was in her first year teaching, shy book nerd. I, a senior held back in a class of juniors, would stand over her, lean in too close, raise my hand not to correct her, but to flirt. And destabilize

Purity of memes produced & distributed via imgboards & irc is corrupted by dopamine infrastructure of metricized social networks. U like & RT shit memes not bc u like it but bc it triggers a propagation protocol; for same reason, holds promise of engagement rewards in return.

Memes have changed. You've seen many spread, unfunny, spark no joy. I speak, of course, of the iterative memes, that make reference to a joke but are not jokes in itself.

Yes, I’m from a background of extreme wealth. No, I’m not a psychopath, just high iq & undersocialized. Distant parents, raised by nursemaids in a large empty house, and teen demands of a high stakes always-on social scene leads one to be emotionally stunted. This is by design.

who is this

I was thinking about it last night. Thinking about the humble reaction image, how it turned into all this.

Its been amusing to observe the frustration as this group’s changing tides resulted in most of the old guard suddenly get out-clouted into irrelevance w only the laurels of hollow follower counts to rest on, due to algorithmic forces entirely beyond their control or understanding

The illusion is (1) that it’s universal and (2) organic. It’s tribal, not individual, twitter organizes users into groupings & within them boosts the clout accounts w consistently good engagement. why a 3k acct can have more clout to a 15k, many straggler followers are out group.

To be clear, what I mean is twitter evaluates the performance of every tweet, and if you do well, it makes you more prominent. Clout isn’t an illusion, nor the feeling that two people with identical follower counts/ratios might have entirely different “clout” feeling.

One thing people don’t realize about twitter “clout” is its not merely a social descriptor of prominence, nor objective count of impressions, but a matrix of variables hidden away somewhere in the black box algorithm, self-reinforcing and tested daily. A performance, judged.

One might say their unwelcoming unsympathetic hostility to the autistic mind is the best indictment of leftism. Then is it not also true my boundless patience and understanding of the same the strongest vindication of Miya? https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1181788515660529664?s=21 …

Also, have u heard the noises some of them make when they talk? They could talk normal if they just tried, you know. Or stop making those awful, ugly noises. They don’t try though. They think they’re above the “hearing”. The deaf “identity” is The worst cancer of cripple culture.

rent free seethe

The only people who don’t detest “the deaf” have never met “the deaf”. They debate circumcising their good baby’s ears by leadpour to keep their deafcult reproductive. Can you imagine? They teach hearing children to “sign”. Forbid talking in the home. Ban deaf marriage.

Would you marry a deaf girl? No. You may marry a blind, a cripple, even a leper; but the deaf adopt their own language: forming deaf social networks, a deaf culture, villages of the deaf - leaving only marriages between the deaf. And yet the children are not, but Bastards.

If you were to take their apologetic rhetoric at face value, you must be surprised to see their unforgivingly callous & cruel mistreatment of the evidently “neurodivergent”, their impatience and inconsideration, their sneering, self centered distaste. But I am not surprised.

Every time I lurk into the comment threads of any leftist post, after I acclimate myself to the immense ambient wall of delusional cope & sift past all the rote manipulative gaslighting...I find the quiet, long reply chains relentlessly harassing innocent, lost, confused autists.

they’ve never touched a screenprinter in their lives, no one is printing anything themselves. everyone knows those print on demand digital heat transfer threads are trash, it’s pure grift for a loyalty buy, “please support a fellow redditor.”

just like the only real programmer is one who uses computers to level where they hav genuine need for niche programs that doesn’t exist and so codes it into existence; the only real drip is designed by those w drip needs that the market doesn’t serve. Palm tree logo tees ain’t it

if they had any authentic sensibility, not just lifestyle-imitating grifters begging for a “brand” pitybuy, they would’ve done a neon short shorts line, maybe collage with Kommando store to bleach and dye the Rhodesian shorts? rather than just print on demand logo tees...lol

Only problem is developer abandoned it before implementing anti spam, ip range bans etc. so they suffered to remain in hidden boards

You don’t understand. Real-time is a different ballpark. All real-time launches are runaway successes. 8000 posts in 12 hours. This is probably higher ppd than all the random splinter chans combined lmao.

?

wot is snooze theory

I do consider it such, in the normal case; I think I’ve tweeted before it’s a solid heuristic against T deficiency. But in case of celibacy towards spiritual growth, you wud submerge sexual energy & internalize it as Qi; morning wood & nocturnal emissions reflects failure in this

just quote tweet and say “the leopard effect”. Works for me

I was actually thinking of @D1C0MM, my friend, when I typed “the desert”

You misunderstand. I outline two paths to sexual mediation enlightenment. Celibacy converts all pent up sexual energy to Qi; if you still experience it physically, it has not been converted. This Sexual energy is good too tho, if cultivated and harnessed well, reconverted inwards

You’re not familiar with Jared Diamond? His entire book is extremely elaborate, convoluted cope to find a universalist alternatives to what is obviously a product of ethnic IQ disparity (denied without basis); and its a pillar of midwit progressive ideology.

Lol

Women were never “disenfranchised” in US democracy, bc men were never franchised - the household was. Wot suffrage did was delineate the vote from one household in unison to husband & wife in discretion; another step down from that noble 1st standard: landed ppl get rights only.

Laws only apply to persons with in a society & to be guilty of breaking them is to be unpersoned within a society, unprotected against any murder or theft. Scottish law. Landed persons receive more rights than unlanded persons & are only people franchised in any community dispute

lmao

Don’t beleive in “due process” for anything except land dispute, as was originally ordained in the Mgana Carta clause from which the Americans extrapolated a due process across entire legal system. A judge should be sovereign in his own court held only against the will of society

easy to forget underread underexposed lefties exist on these fringes who would actually think the anti-semitism is the twist on a conspiracy spiel and not the assumed starting point (zionism is named in the first subject line FYI). the twist relates to the double psyop meme

Ruthless, cold,  unforgiving

you’re thinking of Virginia

midwit, We do not care with what much your nitpickery agrees

painting after that period became dominated by conceptualism; the question of competency whether through abstract figuration or realistic becomes irrelevant. Cope by hiding poor technical skill through “stylish abstraction” is mainly in the lower draw arts

Yeah i know, photorealistic painting is pure midwit, im confident landshark thinks so, wot he likely confused it with is realistic figurative form. The kind of cliche point stands mostly for contemporary drawfigs tho, modernists were are all technically trained, but

What landshark meant was technical competence, not photorealism

Where a peasant revolt deposing the king is read as a sign of their divine right to rule, thus the sovereignty is transferred as a direct expression of power in practice. I believe European monarchy practiced a de facto Mandate of Heaven, by eliminating defective first sons.

Like Frederick the Great. You should read his "Anti-Machiavel", his refutation of Machiavellianism. This is the model for how I run my discord server, a sovereign king with the prosperity of the state as proxy for my own prosperity. Anyway, in China they have a Mandate of Heaven

With the State. Selfish, cold, calculating psychopathy is actually desirable in this situation. Psychopathic actors are only dangerous where their interests do not lie with the State as a whole, but personal influence, wealth etc. But this wouldn't be true with a Sovereign king l

Overstated. Think about it, there's a lot of checks and balances to overthrow a bad ruler. So a mental defect is born as your first son? Just quietly dispose of him. The possibility of a "psychopath" may be more dangerous, but the sovereign state model would align His interests w

Why am I monarchist? If you think about it, monarchy is much more stable than modern democracy. The government only changes hands every 60 years or so, rather than every 4.

Last time I watched anime. Like 2 yrs ago

Due to NGE’s xtreme otaku popularity, gainax/anno’s become sorely misunderstood both by dimwit fans & by ppl poisoned by exposure to them; same fate Shaft suffers following Madoka. But theyre v honestly experimental, deft auteur studios; unfortunately paired w the likes of KyoAni

just read rest of thread. Its plot very deep as far as plot’s read as comedic/tragic depictions of archetypally resonant themes, not mere synoptic plot - as it shud be. ur crit belongs to Trigger studio, not Gainax. Rewatch, its true heart is unpretentious, free spirited & moving

On the other hand, have never bothered finishing any TRIGGER anime

It’s only interesting to me aesthetically. Also I think most fans watch it in retrospect as a depiction of their now past coming of age, it goes over most ani kids heads; it’s not actually that popular, just smoking girl makes for good avi

flcl one of my favorite OVAs. pls reconsider

#MAGA twitter uncovers the most revealing anecdotes of deep America. “Knew a guy” stories recorded only once, unliked, in the unread replies of a thread; reflect the true reach of government oppression in the specific & mundane - the honest realm of their possibility. https://twitter.com/lunaticfarmer/status/1254780358203072514 …

Good point

The alternative, by the way, if you missed the boat, is positive grooming as an older man and becoming Her sweetheart, form her into yours. With her dad’s permission.

Can say the same to you. The gut knows what the mind doesn’t

It’s true your first “real” girlfriend, the Sweetheart, always the one you’re destined to marry. Fail that, fail life; so many choose to “shop around” (for one who puts out?) only find themselves compromising for other compromisers. Watch Splendor in the Grass 1961, to the end. https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1254545654313111554 …

Yep exactly. It’s linguistic xenophobia

The dimwit’s “big words” accusation usually does not refer to char or syllable count, but etymological proximity to old Greek. Often not obscure in any modern n-gram, but will be over the centuries: lacking the wear that rounds hard edges suitable to loan into Romance languages.

Yeah it’s just a masturbatory gimmick to try to make something forgettable novel, like doing a movie in all long cuts. Midwit bait

diegetic just means it happens within the narrative, eg diegetic music is heard by the characters, not past the “fourth wall” by the viewer. It’s a problem not because the word is obscure (it’s not long) but bc midwit redditors love the gimmick thinking its some deep “realism”

I’m not saying it’s untrue, I have stated as much with confidence as early as January. What is believed is real, and confirmation bias is belief; the conspiracy actioned on leads to its own manifestation as true.

The hackz0rz targeting WH0, G@tes & Wuh@n L@bs specifically is peak conspiracy hyperstition, belief in the theory manifesting its own evidence; all data is confirmatory to some degree, more data the more confirmation - the hack’s biased dataset is unconditional narrative victory.

The US will be devastated, no doubt, but it will be an economic consequence. There are no genuine attempts to implement Gates’ ID2020 etc in this round, its alt-sensationalism. But 20% unemployment? This means race riots.

Tbh am doubtful of corona quarantine measures, as close to martial law as they are, meaningfully affecting people’s freedom index overton’s window. A temporary NEET life can quickly be recovered from. Loss of everyone job on quarantine-end, however, will not be

@RiverrunStately knows this, most of u do not, this is why he is hated

To have spent one’s youth in anonymous revelry, days melt together, a social battery, so many women met, personalities inbibed, so many memories awash with alcohol from noontime on—this is a man in his best element. A disastrous, self-destructive relationship; a public fury.

Only great culture is found in drunken conversation of the extremely delicate, rare social SCENE.. the conditions that generate good parties, repeatedly. Most people in life have never attended one good party, let alone a party community in iteration. It is the universal sublime.

No, censorship is not a significant threat vector periodt. You know nothing about discord, it’s anything goes, the darkest edge runs free. only garbage fire public servers on a rapid reincarnation schedule ever get hammered, by their own design.

I’ve stated as much before, you misread my wordplay. Take some time off to consider the provocation target so upset you, and you may learn where this mental parasite lives.

Except Discord server bans are not a significant threat vector, and as easily solved as anywhere else: you just respawn. this is where the larp fails and why “alternative” solutions trying to solve the non-problem remain dead and worthless.

The national socialist model is perfect moderation model for every online community. Any disagreement with this lies from either misunderstanding of natsoc, misunderstanding of online communities, likely both. Will elaborate later

You will understand where you are wrong when you understand narcissism is categorically large of soul.

Personal server infrastructure for sake of network robustness is not same as independently hosted webring, which may easily rely on cloud infra, as point is community & free exit. I am making an identical point as my point with Discord as de facto decentralized.

But liked by Nick. Many twits brand as acc but very few have actually swallowed the pill, the postanthropocentric revelation of scale humanity without agency, self-organizing only under capitalism's yoke. Anyone who has not accepted this commits themselves to irrelevance.

When I say "worker's rights" are an abomination, I mean it as in "abomination against nature". It doesn't matter whether you or I believe they're good or bad, man is not the agent, only a vessel, one who is quietly being outmoded; you are watching the pretense slowly fall apart.

Lmao

You misunderstand, my analysis is not a statement of support but an elucidation on reality: what is, not what I wish to be.

Yeah... outperform an INDEX of mutual funds.. Circular argument?

The worker's gains in productivity are not from himself, but in financial, operational and mechanical sophistication around him; thus the profits are dispersed above him, and not to he, who has not changed in value. Management gives everyone a better drill, but why a raise?

Its true, the market's distorted, inefficient. But the problema's not financialization, not poshuman algorithm or arcane meta-speculations. Its their hindrance by state interventions, manipulated politics mandating such abominations as "worker's rights". And so they will be shed.

Layman's threatened by financial vehicles reaching a complexity incomprehensible to them, so cry out "exploitative!" "absurd!" "pointless" Cope will not stall capitalism's march, but theyre right to be threatened...how far we've come from mere double-entry accounting, how quickly

Trist disobeyed Polk's direct orders in designing the treaty. Cope

Slavebrain cope always confuses "finance" w bureaucratic inefficiency; the fact that financial sector dominates the GDP is not an example of "corruption" or "inefficiency" but sophistication, a higher order efficiency; the worker is made more productive despite himself. https://twitter.com/metadiogenes/status/1244168583023902721 …

Just remembered I had another mech kb someone gave me that I also broke by spilling beer, lol. Keyboards and sunglasses I decided are things I'd rather keep cheap & disposable, I run thru them too fast lawl

Yes exactly. People deride it is as "throwaway culture" but it's not that the thing is disposable, easily replaceable, but irrepairable.

Thinking about broken hearts and mindbroken women, suicide texts and booty calls

Thinking about lounges in the sun at other people's pools, drinks in dark pool bars, barely escaping rape danger at hotel room parties, tearing down anonymous stairways, phone calls and light smears in the night, black uber driver playing Frankie knuckles catharsis.

Thinking about the strong jawed olive toned lithe Mexican noise punk with a feather in his left ear driving a beater in the hot Santa Ana sun in 2012, the French expat Aurora who fell In ecstasy love at a trap house in taiwan, the dog mom yaris botch who cut me off 3 years ago.

No, I don't want to see the virus contained. A world of social distancing, closed borders, local supply chains, 10% of the global population left standing, this is the world I want to live in. When the old world shut down their economy for weeks at a time, it was called festival. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1242112281204252677 …

The fed desperately dumping trillions into the economy to make up for a total economic shutdown IS the road to collapse, this IS letting it all burn, by the way. NOT doing so is the road to "recovery". The USD will be incredibly devalued at the end of this charade.

must understand, starving economy will destroy far more human life than a viral pandemic. Let the virus run free, society's reorganization into a symbiotic steady state is  healthy. not as simple as "fed print money bad", the keynesian pumps r response to quarantine's shutdown.

Slave take. Sacrifice the people not the economy. Economy is the blood of society, flow of human industry. The many homeless, impoverished & elderly "at-risk" are dead cells; the political institutions bent on preserving them, for false value assigned to life-in-itself: a cancer. https://twitter.com/KANTBOT20K/status/1242002578193481728 …

Saw a post lamenting the "doomsday clock" was moved forward to 100 secs from midnight, not because of the china virus, but Greta Thunberg's eco alarmism. Do they know the pandemic moves the clock backwards, not forwards, reversing exactly the industrial globalism Greta fears?

You must understand, economic martial law "shelter-in" shutdowns is unprecedented - there have been curfews, occupations, razings, but never a closure of the economy itself, of industry. Nothing is "non-essential", except modernity itself: who now you are seeing get rolled back. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1241074336561123328 …

No. The value the CEO brings to the company in comparison to the market value of alternative CEO's they could replace him with. It is the same decision in deciding to pay a coder $12/hr or $50/hr. If you pay less than their value, someone else will steal them.

Yes, he needs to be paid exactly his value contribution to the company; or else another company would offer him his worth as it would be in exchange for the value generated. The exact same mechanism is true of the factory worker's pay as it is the CEO's.

salary is a simple supply/demand price valuation. if the high value CEO was not paid well, they get headhunted by another company for a more worthy salary. the cream rises to the top. your equation is rule by the incompetent.

Why would you not pay them lol. the model is already ultra-efficient, salary in a headhunting environment is a sorting algorithm

Look around. Every last bodega, hole in the wall, mom & pop, corner store, boutique that has been forced to shut down this week will never, ever come back when the economic martial law is lifted in 3 weeks. The small business is over.

Yes. Grasshopper titles always slept on. Btw u should play lost in blue 2 on nds if u haven't you will like

You will note on my feed I have historically advised prepping for collapse with an offensive armory and tribal power networks; otherwise, with a secured bankroll ready to leap on near-collapse rebound "blood in the streets" discounted opportunity.

We have far more to fall. This friday dead cat bounce was obv manipulated, Corp bonds haywire, full effects of industry shutdown in EU/US yet to be seen. Mass layoffs only just begun. We are looking at simultaneous demand AND supply crunch, unprecedented, you must understand this

Coronavirus' real consequence has nothing to do with lives, but economic isolationism. The 3% human capital shred's NOTHING compared to wealth destroyed in corona's aggressively immediate antiglobalism, u must understand this; and this is where the real blood will pile up, anyway

We are on the precipice of an extreme financial crash & global supply chain collapse & y'all are busy countersignalling panic preppers for buying toilet paper. A world order reversal like this happens once an era, I don't think u understand the amount of wealth upheaval occurring

Miya's reminder: price gouging is the most efficient & most accurate way low supply high demand necessities are given to those who genuinely, truly "need it most"; especially when only alternative sorting algorithms are literally equal rations, or at best "first come first serve"

More disruptive to the stock market, which is most disruptive to life. The fallout from this period will remember the crash it caused, not the deaths-justifiably.

The coronavirus is a 4D meme, both a material virus and immaterial, as an idea; a viral meme deeply tied to viral trauma in the Real, one of the first cases of true disaster in the internet generation, and first in history to be amplified by the internet's unreality machine.

Esoteric prepping as alternative to the boomer consoomer costco garage is basic permaculture garden, meat curing, fruit canning, herb & spice garden, fermentation crocks, raising chickens & goats for eggs and milk & meat, &, most importantly, a discipline of extended fasting. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1238551240943890432 …

No. Dilute it according to use and buy by the gallon. It's the cheapest possible option.

you can replace every household cleaner you use from handsoaps, to body wash, to dish detergent, laundry, floors, etc. with combinations of literally just these 5 items, non-toxic and 1/10th the price, plus any random essential oils for scent. pic.twitter.com/sx6YQ6D9wp

It is too late to stock up on canned goods. Last minute shopping guide, I recommend you stock up on water, beans, refined coconut oil, raw acv and salt; buy bulk fruits and learn to can them, get chickens for eggs and grow potatos, they're easy to learn. And learn to fast, lol

Dm's asking for prep advice. Major essentials are some kind of cooker, a coop and chicks for eggs, herb garden and semi perma vegetable, berry & nut tree garden. water, rice, beans. bulk coconut oil, honey, canning salt, canned meat (yoder's brand), canned fruit, + raw acv, vodka

ok simp

We have far further to fall. If you think toilet paper is bad, wait until you see real supply chain collapse. There will be blood in the streets.

Properly pursued, the only real financial risk associated with childrearing as investment is the possibility of a daughter.

People think kids are a waste of money to raise and that college is investment. They got it backwards. College is a money shredder but kids are cheap investments with high ROI, very profitable - if you keep them in the home, assign them to a trade, pool the collective income.

White working class financial splendour isn't hard, and the answer IS trades. What people don't understand is is true financial utopia, that stable median of convenient luxury of the middle class at its peak, is the MULTI-generational trade: its the trade as family company.

Yes. and family* business. mistake people make is branching out hiring mexican or chinese, as white manager. Will never work out, and white union rates are too high to reasonably support without high IQ franchise efficiency. keep the trade in family, you keep the money in family.

No. They only incentivize more homeless, expanding the problem and suffering therewithal. The solution is starving them.

What are the good charities? Medical charities are categorically invalidated by modern medicine's anti-hippocraticism; unless its medical terrorism. Economic charities are too bc subsidization is incentivization. Good charities are only green, for plants & animals. What are they?

If you meet any "cinephile" who uses Michael Bay as a foil of blockbuster studio dregs against the auteur, against artistic merit, against his self fashioned auteurism of taste—kill him. Paul W. S. Anderson has produced more depth of cinema than Paul or Wes Anderson combined.

Auteur theory in modern film crit is so bunk; just mean the directors identifiable, rarity in age of the studio movie, standard today - superhero directors are named auteurs. Now used as label of quality, "are videogames art?": Is Bay an auteur? Of cours, most of anyone this gen.

Forget about privacy meme, it's about what comes back, not what leaves, that's dangerous: any algorithm that returns feedback based on your input is subconsciously training you, incredibly dangerous manipulation, forging you zombie virus receptacle. Yes, twitter included.

What non-"private" apps achieve is user tracking, and it is not the tracking that is pernicious but what they do with it-not sending it to the government, but using it for personalized feedback, for "recommendation algorithms". THIS is dangerous, this is training you, fear THIS.

Your security is only found in compartmentalization; seek not "privacy" not "anti-tracking", but anti-compromisation, anti-deanonymization. Attempting to blanket yourself from surveillance is a forced meme to distract you from contingency planning from inevitable leaks.

Midwits hate Alexa because they've been trained to cherish "privacy". The platitude is true, if you're not doing anything wrong, you've nothing to hide. It's true too, there is nothing one can do wrong; there are no Alexa arrests, no fruits of their snooping. "Privacy" is an op

Alexa is lame you say? Not when you learn you can set her trigger word to "computer". Suddenly we are launched into the future of the 80s, you cannot deny it, you cannot cringe. Computer! Weather. Computer! Time. Computer! Play Vivaldi. Computer!

I've outfitted my home with Alexa's, and I love it. Music rebounds where it never did before in fear of the mental abuse any impromptu "bluetooth connection" demands; and how the lights wake to greet me, and the ease with which I set alarms. That's all it can do, but it's enough.

The fact that "prepping" is distinctly American-blooded pasttime proves her perennial superiority over the leftover continent; and make no mistake, there's little more American than an obtuse, unjustified certainty of fantastical apocalypse sated by industrial consumer collecting

Yeah, it's not a bad one. with most subreddits it's best just to read their sticky & sidebar for what information they've converged on but not look too closely at their regular postings; I'm pretty sure the majority of regular reddit lurkers do this too

Reddit as a whole has a very distinct but hard to summarize taste extending from an identity formed around being an "informed consumer"; something about its system conditions all its communities into the ditch of reading exhaustive reviews to settle on mismatched meme products.

redditor "Buy it for life" conception beyond only [lifetime guarantee] is just middle class aspirational infatuation w quality conflated with rose-tinted past pretentions, tho; distinct reddit trap. Most high-end goods r accidentally "built for life" in pursuit of quality

Docs ended their warranty offer. I used to stan Doc Martens hard but they moved production to China and have begun using very shitty, thin leather, even with their Made in England line; no longer buy them. Solovair produces from their original factory, much better quality.

Yeah was thinking about that w this post, a few years ago I mined that community for reference after discovering the lifetime warranty thing in LL Bean. Patagonia, Outdoor Research are best, Filson and North Face cover manufac defect. Also Jansport backpacks, Hydroflask

I've spent about $300 to replace all my socks with a dozen Patagonia brand socks. Theyre expensive and a bit tough, but I'll never have to buy new socks again. Each one is a lifetime-subscription, permanent buy-in to a personal co-operative, their store my mere on-demand renewal. pic.twitter.com/9VD66whDov

Some consumerism transcends time. We all know mechanical watches descend forever, and of grandmother's furs. But did you know the Patagonia brand carries a no questions asked lifetime warranty? As long as it's not lost, they'll replace it. A curious lindy of the theseus stripe.

Because there is no separation between the physical and metaphysical. You must understand this.

I know, it's just funny misunderstanding of the point of notation how that translates to his notetaking, now that you put it that way, it's almost another, direct vocalization, this time by ink.

The hallmark of true book note scribbling is getting in argument with the author and/or yourself of a previous iteration. These guys need to just stick to single color highlighting

It's always surreal seeing these wrongly taken notes seem to just convey the feeling of reading in t moment; point in that passage was /disagreeing/ w an allegorical interpretation but he just circled th trigger word still, like how he double underlined "has" bc it was italicized

Crocs are good too, I use them from bathroom slippers

Birkenstocks Arizona EVAs are the perfect guest slippers, for the record

hm.

This is something I think about sometimes when I admire a woman's beauty.

Most do it wrong though. The painfully ugly pink and blue $1 throwaways, or cotton cushioned slippers as if it is a personal home slipper. No. only wood, rattan or some kind of rubber are acceptable -- guest slippers must be washed between every use.

—In any case, holding her arms I asked her her floor but she started to claw at me and scream, so I dropped her to the floor & slipped out just as the elevator doors closed, sealing her away; then ran into my own date in the lobby, us both drunk ourselves, I followed her instead.

—perhaps derobed or groped by a grandfather? Something along those lines, where decorum of her background prevented her from stopping the shamefulness, but the shamelessness of her uncouth in-laws did not prevent them from taking advantage. Maybe I saw it in a movie, or past life

"ruining Everything." not sure if she was the bride or bride's sister. her dress and hair were rustled, clearly drunk from misery; sudden flashback to distant memory, not sure from where, of a woman shamefully mistreated in public by her married family, utterly reduced

one time I was returning from late drinks in the bar of a luxury hotel out by the persian Gulf, and a woman in traditional dress stumbled into my elevator, extremely drunk & sobbing, I had to lift her off the floor, she was yelling something about her mother in law ..

A woman looks most beautiful wistful, from behind a window—waiting; for a reason. It's is her role, after all, to wait.

good question maru https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1162800886885699584?s=20 …

Has it ever occurred to you just WHY all women's "favorite books" exist only on the "YA Fiction" plane? Yes, even the much-touted "educated woman" has yet to surpass the Young Adult ceiling, that mental developmental barrier, have U ever really stopped to think WHY that might be?

They've factory produced hordes of hello world coders who can't hack a solution to a problem if their life depended on it, not without an enterprise project manager guiding them; and only if there's money, to recover glorified code camp degree investment

Only 20 years in the past, if one had a computer need, they hacked the solution, then provided online for anyone else who might have same need. Now average user is entirely technically illiterate, so everyone just sits and waits until the benevolent corporation provides solution.

Amazing how quickly DIY programming culture failed to a point where they now can't address the most widely demanded needs - just discovered there's no solution to sorting Amazon listings by price per unit rather than total price, though its entirely possible with Amazon's API.

This is only right answer, second is Kafka on the Shore. Internet aesthetes dreaming up meme gfs will never understand, YA fic is literally all you need

When I see an "educated female" I see a deep sinkhole, a blackhole of wealth burned to achieve absolutely nothing, or worse: education an indoctrination in further financially dysgenic ideology, plus sexual record to make her unmarriagable to any decent man. To "invest" in this!

Perhaps the most pernicious myth of personal finance shredding is "investing in female education", in a daughter who leaves to enter another family with not even a dowry traded in return, who will never use her "education" for any actual career, or worse: might, and no children.

You must weaponize irony, tailor it towards intended actualization. Do you want to be a blind vehicle for memes? Or make memes your vehicle? Think about it. https://twitter.com/doomerchad/status/1233273119936253952 …

but yes i did use the phrase "extreme wealth" intentionally and strategically placed at the beginning to stoke the fire

my point is that the upper echelons of society are experience a lot more abuse than any other; much psychic trauma from parents, later translates to sexual trauma from their broken circles; such that the trope of neglectful parent would appear a blessing.

I want to amputate you feet

you are the homeless guy/

The self-gaslighting process is accelerated so aggressively on the internet compared to real life because online socialization produces a fictional identity given digital life as a believed egregore nakedly subjected to intense abuse then re-internalized by their handlers, btw. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1233063599779672064 …

Raised in a context of extreme wealth, I was lucky to have been a neglected child, a left to her own devices child. I was lucky to have been a reclusive child, a staring child. The higher the class, greater the depth of human experience experienced: the greatest, deepest abuses.

Ironic homosexuality makes you gay. LARPing as anything will meme it into existence—the subconscious doesn’t read the nuance of irony. This is premise of PUA as self-help, alpha simulacrum.

To a normie, talking about Taiwanese new wave cinema or Mongolian politics is equally as obscure esotericism as ancient Atlantis or missing 411 or Vitamin K2, and the only delicacy U need to manage is their intellectual insecurity—they feel it’s threatening that you’re well read.

That's exactly my point. There is no revolution found in politics.

For you, I recommend Manuel De Landa, 1000 years of Nonlinear History, and War in the Age of Intelligent Machines.

The meme goes, the lemming masses only care about politics when it effects their bottom line. No, they don't ever care about politics, they care about their bottom line. Why would anyone ever care about politics?

Lemming normie cares about their bottom line - their family, their job, their house. Being into politics at all is already extremism, it's already delusional. Get a little financial stability in them, they're open: politics is a pasttime, of course they like it interesting.

want to crush your 4'7" into a sidewalk patty cake I hate you so much

An aside: the king meme as a misogyny normalizer is its most potent formulation. I will call you king when you post dms mogging women, tell them you want to crush their head between their palms and they reply "thats hot". This is the move.

Yeah, it's just a silly meme; but nothing is just a meme, theyre powerful expressions of the collective noosphere.  kingposting communities prove themselves weak against the alternative, hard banter, where u call your friends cvnts & strangers mates. Only one breeds strong horses

Not that misogyny is problem; it's first step to the mannerbund. Kingposting just seems to contradict protocols of self-improvement, puts cart behind horse under presumption social approval can be proxy for self-confidence. It shares all the flaws "yass queen" was mocked for.

Kingposting isn't exclusive to bodybuilder community. It's also popular with 30 yr old doomer ironybros and fornite zoomers, with identical use. What is shared is male domination: its encoded message is misogyny, not self-improvement.

Allow me lil meme archaeology: kingposting originates in ironically paralleling female "yass queen" posting. It began to be used post-ironically as part of larger reclamation of male-to-male affection w/in dominately male online circles; unironic peer support, same as yass queen.

They're all already fully complicit: ANY participation from within the community to outsiders IS grooming by default. Transgenderism is a fetish cult, proselytizing to non-members their recruiting.

Yet not so for the tr&nner! While their recent prominence and proliferation might only be an accident of progressing intersectionalism, their accidental radicalness has already thoroughly dismantled feminist gender theory and unraveled intersectionality. Just one push through...

The only purpose its false praise serves is making people feel complacent without accomplishment. Anyone thinking needing it for a "confidence boost" has that as their biggest issue; and without it, it's only malicious.

Yes, but by delusion-grade I mean to the point where you can be described as "delusional"; absolutely divorced from reality, a point of no return without extreme intervention. Many incels absorbed in a self-hating feedback loop are like this; kingposting brings you to their level

It started as an ironic imitation of female “yass queen” posting, then turned unironic, under a meninist frame of “men aren’t loved” bc bodybuilders and adjecent communities are at median insecure, feminized betas that unironically feel good receiving empty praise.

No, a peasant with a crown is crippled by dharma-denying slave morality. The crown is his cage, his chains that certifies his self-enslavement. A peasant simply a peasant bears a nobility in his own right, living in simple contentment, standing far taller than the crowned slave. https://twitter.com/MorrowQiang/status/1232337707239723008 …

It’s very rarely conscious, but intuited by the smarter few who imitate it and adopted by the dumber lot, who intuit is as beneficial once it’s presented. Normies are very uncomfortable with this everyday manipulation being performed consciously, they call that psychopathy.

Only time lying to call someone king for “confidence boost” is plausibly justified are the incel blackpills deeply crippled by delusion-grade insecurity. This is level of omega loser u become & are forever kept at when u kingpost - peer gaslighting is only thing keeping u going.

they’ll cry “b-b-b-but miya, it’s making up for Society keeping boys down!” Never take your advice from these eternal betas, they’re slaves in a bucket keeping you dragged down to their level. Hear me: Men have never needed social approval to be men. Virtue is a private endeavor.

You must understand, women are facetious when they make displays of accepting their peer’s ugliness; it’s a strategy designed to neuter competition, keeping them complacent in weakness. Kingposting is identical malice: real bros call you a lil botch when you’re lacking, not king.

If you want a vision of men dug into their own ditch, imagine “yasss king slay!!! 🤤 👑” posted under a lanklet getting mad online, forever.

So please.

To be clear, you using the wrong word betrays a colloquial illiteracy; and that your sophistry stems from masturbating “alliances” didn’t need to be said; you should already know I’m repulsed by both—you’re worth less than I previously thought.

This is simply irreciprocation, a repudiation of my good grace. Defrauding would suggest the favor was initially obtained through deception, when you merely asked out of the blue. My impression of you is quickly lowering.

I don’t care about my imitators or their reputation, but what you described is doubtful and suspect; and, as you should already know, I like to observe all aspects of my reception and influence. Show me, you owe me for my reading.

Wtf is an askbox. Show me, I want to observe the situation.

that’s not spam, that’s just getting rhetorically mogged. Midwits always erreneously cry spam in these situations, which is why I pressed it to confirm. In any case, still don’t believe; why would these randoms I’ve never interacted with receive even my most distant groupies?

Ket was definitely the drug of the 2010s; it took over the club underground, was the new molly; as well any trap house trust fund backed enough to  afford it. You should try it some more, it’s a drug with great depth

Ket has plateaus, same as coke. Small dose is a short lived addy like conversation stimulant; low makes you loopy; mid turns you lizard brain and high you in the hole/into space.

I know what you mean. It’s Dwell culture; they’re reduced to icons of a platonic Good Design Taste, ironically independent of any cohesion with the interior design, just a bourgeois signifier.

Barcelona chairs have been iconic of architectural design fetishism since at least the 80s. Tom Wolfe wrote about it. Cult of Mies and all that.

These days I preface all my esoteric nutrition conversation with “a Bulgarian bodybuilder friend told me...”

what did he do

Theres quite a few. Crawford’s Balance of Power is earliest I can think of. only thing spec ops did new was a fourth wall breaking questioning of agency in the gulf war setting; it’s a common trope otherwise, Max Payne did it. Ppl only reference Spec Ops bc vidya history amnesia

TV? No thanks, boomer I only watch “Alexa youtube search vedic mystery ancient”

Flipping on Yakub and Atlantis youtube videos on the smart TV  at the kickback is the same degree of “move” as putting sc mixtapes on the aux instead of spotify trap. It’s not that edgy, just a bit alt. It’s what Space Ghost: Coast to Coast and Sealab 2021 was in the 00s.

Biggest conspiracy redpill is its inherently accessible to normies—when presented, not in regurgitation, but in video; not as revelation, but as entertainment (as it is); not in private, but socially, gathered at couch. “Mystery/conspiracy” is a tv genre, just badly researched.

stop hitting on me with negging it will never work. I only accept submission

Your straw man is the exact opposite of the recommendation, the recommendation, within your formulation, being asceticism as a path to enlightenment.

Lawl

I suspect sensitivity to “cheating” and “junk food” is due to the fragility and dependency of inherently weakening modern diets, both generic and “healthy” - a kind of addiction, that allows you to function but only when continuously indulged but falls apart when broken.

About to hop in the shower with a beer. I’ve wrote elsewhere, when you eat & live well, “cheat foods” can be indulged in frequently without ill effect. The body is resilient, it’s the base standard that’s important

that’s the mf who eats raw cow brain straight outta the skull at vegan protests right? lol

You must understand, all wisdom comes from within. There’s nothing to hear, nothing to read, that you can’t already know yourself—if only attuned. You must understand there is no barrier between body & mind, as there is no barrier to the physical & metaphysical. You must underst

Conversely, you must understand it all begins with nutrition. There is no far right, no traditionalism, without a return to the true diet, and only from it will we discover virtuous action. Diet and politics are the strongest correlation - not IQ, not education, not geography.

A nutrition can be right-wing—it’s true: eating meat & fat is a politicized rejection of progressive world order’s “green” “ethical” diet—bc true nutrition leads to a true mind leads to true politics. It is the first step; a nutrition of slaves leads you to only into their yoke.

It’s true btw, good for immunity.

These kinds of wordplay jokes are truest expression of an internalized esoteric worldview, like how some misinterpretations of subtext are distinctly autistic; or stories of abos and such incomprehensibility with future time - betrays an entire alt reality behind their eyes

Then why take offense to Japan requiring their sterilization for recognition. It’s inherent step to transitioning; they will never successfully pass without it.

To put it another way, internet is for people who came of age in the 90s & 00s, born into it, or the 60s & 70s, who, if they’re online now, were building it, academics. Most introduced in the 80s are IT contractors today, see as a profession; you see a content gap from that gen.

@nyaggers which part

Show me the priv posts

Reason it works, same with all trips, is while normal troll is infallible prankster-drifter, the trip’s entwined in th community, reveals his own flaws, same as he exploits theirs. He’s smug & mocking but u know he’s same as u are, yet u can’t reach him. Thus frustration & resent

Not a baby, a child; should be treated with infinite patience and understanding. A mom’s love for her children, her small world built entirely around them, is much like a child’s innocence. Use only firmness to guide them, not anger. Just try to accept her, she’ll accept you too.

Those against him, so repeatedly played the be fool by him, would do well to heed my elucidation of his method. one should really think I am taking allegiance against, if only they could admit their defeat, but still no; only sideline commentary.

I’m not allying with anyone. I appreciate Ulysses’ trolling as a connoisseur of the art; but I do have disagreements w his actual stance & am aware of his vulnerabilities. None of the people who “hate” him are aware of either, tho; he plays them for fool.

he’s a classic nu-chan era tripfig - role playing the inflammatory rtard bc it works to get newfigs riled up & pissed off, ballooning a massive artificial ego to feed the cringe RP; the rep allowing the handler employ increasingly dumb trolls, maling room for injected subtext.

You don’t though. Muja is my simp is secure enough to accept flattery is the way to my heart

U shud know by now uly doesn’t “genuinely” beleive the literal of what he’s saying. It’s a troll designed to stir up the suburbanite larpers, and it works; the genuine subtext is secondary but necessary to be true for the primary to work, and meaningful for it

Interestinn. I did not know my little Mujaya tweeted philosophy let alone that he was of a similar “voice”

fell for the troll & are misreading the subtext. Keyword “suburbanite”; it’s a false reactionaryism that croons for only earlier modern past, qualitatively identical & largely as malignant as present. True trad calls for much deeper radicalism than simply rejecting enlightenment

Shiba I feel a little bad when I see you post about your mother. You shouldn’t try to reason with her or argue with her or convince her of anything, just accept her; the transition to adulthood as a man is understanding she is your child now, not you hers.

/r/ @'s

Intuitively they know losing it to a random is gonna fuck them up for life.

I've seen it be everywhere, even in degenerate music/drug scenes, I'm surprised to find virgin girls. Ofc they're not wife material, but still. same thing with a lot of the egirls here.

virgin blackpill isn't true, ~1/4 unmarried women 20-25 are virgins in US. They're not uncommon, just hard to tell apart - not like they advertise it. Women are much more aware of female abstinence remaining commonplace than men are. You can tell tho, they're mentally intact.

It does actually. Multipartner nonvirgins re psychically battered, probably masturbators too, they're dysfunctional; all societies considered them only fit for prostitution for a reason. It's also vital you deliver them to orgasm & dont use BC or condoms. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1199783202652471296?s=20 …

It relates to urbanism more than income. Move to the country and relative cost of each child is much lower than in the city, where costs per dependent scale much more linearly due to the service-based economy. Rural families are happier & bigger regardless of income

YO Get in on this bros!!

Enjoy your life of resentment.

Political women replace their father figure with socially derived ideology. It falls apart the moment you take over the position of father figure, as any partner is intended to do. If you can't mog her into submission, you need to raise your T levels or seek lower IQ women.

Financially, I advise you enter sex work. Only a degenerate cuckold would ever marry used goods; this is the damage Society has done - normalizing bastard children.

there literally isn't any non-enlightenment "inalienable human rights poo poo pee pee" argument against slavery

It’s natsoc

this is actually natsoc lol; long term persistence of the community requires anti-“degeneracy” intervention protocol, anti cancer. Libertarianism is only interested in ideological self-preservation

prove it

Every element of top down intervention limits the possibilities of chaotic self organization; but no sovereign structure is too unstable to last long term. Ideal is as little as possible required to persist.

People do this shit all the time. It’s a garbage fire that burns out in an hour. What is required is a stable core structure, very simplistic and fundamental, as unchanging and non interventionist as possible, to be strong enough to withstand full chaos occurring within

Personal censorship is reddit shit. Culture is guided by the core (not democratic) community through shaming, with the moderators acting as their sword when needed. Anything else is cancer

Bored of it. Reveal the method and move on to other games

You have to be a little inflammatory, and mix in a little wronghood. People can’t resist trying to correct others, especially the smugly wrong - best way to get the right answer isn’t providing the right question but a wrong answer.

Basically, u just have to trick the insecure lower IQ posters into shilling you by pretending to be dumber than them. Stealing all their worthwhile followers is a given; the people naturally want to stand with the strong horse. Thanks for the 6K nerds

Left hand path for followermaxxing:
1. post bait
2. get “dunked”, boosting urself on their TLs
3. mog w based & redpilled bantz

still replying? mad.

you seem upset. why are you mad?

okay mad loser

i see

congrats on losing, loser.

Okay, exactly my point if you even read the original meme? this is online not the real world, here YOURE the loser.

t. jealous cloutlet

except youre literally so mad at me u filled youre whole timeline with me and cant stop responding? just take the L and walk away LOL

youre the one who is cringe, youre literally so mad u filled your tl with me. simp much?

ok now you're projecting.

its not loyalty, it was protecting the weak who overextended themselves from due pain through group social manipulation, while he cowered behind blocks. it's very feminine, leftist praxis that only encourages incircle weakness.

if youre trying to troll me again... im not falling for it.

this doesn’t make any sense. This is gibberish

Normies will never understand this: the meaning of anonymity is NOT having no name, its NOT not self-doxxing. It's EGO DETACHMENT, lucid divorce of your digital persona from your IRL.

Imageboard has been dead for a decade; chan cultural diaspora lives on primarily on IRC. Anonymity is achieved on namesites through accelerating identity into a schizophrenia; there is no brand here.

There's no more despicable act online than monetizing content. They're true carpetbaggers, outsiders exploiting closure of frontier, staking false claim on work of the anonymous many for nothing more than a middling penny-stream, a stake driven into heart of what they enroach on. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1230613647837233152 …

lol. if u post cringe, it gets made fun of, simple as. organizing a big group block or whatever is the only "power" they have to relinquish, and its not going to stop anyone from laughing at cringe; running from it just leaves them weak both in appearance and in LT robustness.

Whenever you meet a rulescuck mod ruining all fun in a server, a beta tryhard trying to cancel shitposters, a simp defending womyn, a dramafig obsessively manipulating his friends, any dork who takes hmself srslsy - you're meeting the eternal Goon

This is why i'm relentlessly hostile to the content monetizer, the grifter; as the web undergoes sublimination into the economy, they're the goon archetype in contrast with the channer - the anonymous, credit-less, the robin hood warez scene, the hacker.

Few understand woke ideology vs. freeze peach is just the normiesphere manifestation of ancient goon/chan hyperwar; all its history and procedure can be understood from this lens. its really an information war, between dictatorial control vs. wild west style piracy.

Lots of people who "hate miya", all you talking about me sekretly in group chats: I'm there, we're bros, we're old mutuals, I've always been there, I'm watching all of it, and you've told me everything already. Nothing here is real.

I own 2 other 'mid clout' alts w 2K+ followers & cuple more in 'baby clout' 0.6-1.2K range; they dont much interact w me, they in their own frogtwit networks, sum even my ostensible enemies. Thats just me, & I'm new here, still getting hang of things. Nothing you see here is real

Twitter end-game is getting fedded and turned into an informant/agent. The average poster here, and I mean the actual average, the swathe of nothing accounts, are bots; their opposite, at the peaks, everyone except for me, are zombie actors for arcane powers, living subversions.

tbh there is something deeply amiss afoot with this whole thing, I keep getting strong fed signals in my gut, tho I can't see any rationale for it, BAP's stated ideology is solid and commendable, but something is being fudged. gut says I should wash my hands of them entirely

Ulysses is just a tripfig troll, anyone from chans can see that immediately. He holds up a mirror against the people who get pissed at him - it is what is shown in this mirror that is relevant, not the man holding it.

Gave my analysis on the drama while fresh here; commentary still relevant, and in time since I think the network's moved towards 'git gud' - or maybe all the weaklings disappeared behind blocks. Everyone from the losing team broke moot 4 this thread lol: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1194708068828729344?s=20 …

It was probably his best troll, never have I seen that crew make such a fool of themselves. I dgaf about any of the drama or social politics of this network, but I'm a connoisseur of the art of war, of strong horse rhetoricism: they absolutely got skewered on their own sword.

Truth is they got trolled by ulysses, who was so obnoxious they had to take the opposite stance, dying on a stupidly feminine hill; even unironically pulling out the classic cope of the tasteless middle class: "you can't criticize art unless you make something better!!"

Nah, was between supporting creativity of friends no matter how bad, eternal participation trophy, vs. maintaining authentic critical standard, forcing them to rise up & earn their praise. r vs K-selection; the former obviously the feminine, non-lindy principle & source of drama. https://twitter.com/epigonenzug/status/1230481566901637120 …

He’s referring to Saint Boniface converting Germania (“Tuetons”), but I don’t understand why he describes it as an Odinnic sacrifice - sacrificing germania to germania - or why it would be an annihilation of Abrahamism.

I see. what do u think that Harlan tweet means I can’t parse it tbh

This isn’t their take, it’s an attempt to interpret Hakan’s. lol

Only one I get this suspect gut feeling from. I highly doubt it’s a fed but it’s the same fed vibe, like not just poser artifice, but one coming from a notable distance

I suspect there is something more here to the story. It was OOC for BAP to die on the hill of defending grifterism on the sophistic grounds that “all content is good” in the first place. Doonvor’s profile is eerie

Tbh never saw him on the tl before he released his book and he blocked me immediately after but today I looked at his profile on alt & pointed out its very suspect abt it, almost 0 engagement despite 2k followers except by a small group of midclout BAPists who shilled his release

BAP imitator who wrote and shilled a very cringe book. it’s only really notable bc BAP & friends defended him on the principle that any & all rw content shud be boosted regardless of quality, to the point where they group blocked/broke moot with anyone who laughed at the excerpts

It’s just a line one crosses, when you stop pretending to your opponent that you aren’t playing politics, manipulating & lying behind their back, but as far as they know honest in public; to doing it openly. reason it never starts this way bc it gives them same license in return.

whats there to see. youre the only one in this thread he didnt already have blocked lol

loll

lol

thing I'm most confident about is he's not had a gf, not any real relationship anyway; might have lost virginity in a  college fling with a druggie before she realized he was autism. also  my reading: late 20s, suburban american, uni grad of midtier college. east coast. Virginia

I dont think he lives with his parents, I think he's functional enough to be independent, has a menial job and apartment, but probably never had a gf, doesnt have irl friends except for similar 'pity handlers', probly trainer at the gym and coworkers

wonder whats wrong with him

he already has us all blocked from the first time we laughed at it, followed mommy's advice about bullies like a good little autistic child

post more

this is actually factual. the reason the standard protocol is to shill incircle is as investment in the future case where you content-monetize, to keep them obligated to shill in return; and doonvor is generated entity, literally or figuratively: he's a soulless amalgamation.

half of zero is zero. im starting to believe "doonvor cannon" never actually existed, its just a kind of generated shill that they're all tweetdecking for a cut of the sales

nah it's like a group of 10 ppl max boosting each other, barely even enough to consistently astroturf double digit likes lol pic.twitter.com/9zE2w9dibP

i know, this is how you can see ID the short extent of his reach

no i think its about 6, I'm looking at the RT's and likes now. besides the aforementioned there's also classic age vitalist and the guy who did his graphic design. it's basically onlt that circle boosting each other boosting him; very astroturfed

yes

this is fake news. he has no more than ~3 friends

yes I wonder if the reason that trio of bap guys who appear to be his only fans - midwestsiberian, braddock & bill carson, shred their clout to shill him so hard is just bc they feel bad for the fella, kinda feel bad too for making fun of him

some samples... a lot of it isnt even just cringe, but confused. I don't think he's actually a bot but low IQ autists tend to take on characteristics of neural network writing bc theyre performing a similar heuristic imitation. all his tweets have this little interaction pic.twitter.com/Btgo5geBx7

eerie looking at his profile tbh, reminds me of AI generated fb pages. there's 0 or 1 RTs on almost all his posts, v few likes, no comments; only his google image collages get any attention. seems designed as experiment in cringe, astoturfed from nowhere with sub-zero clout

i looked at his tweets the other day on priv, I think he might literally be a downie grade autist. not just in the low IQ imitation but also the distinct rtrd stubbornness -  there's very little actual interaction despite how forced his content is

This is common - most people who do this are grovelling betas who've accidentally discovered it works, they're not doing it as an ironic troll, no self-awareness; it comes out of their own pathologies that can be identified and exploited. I have destroyed many 'groomers'.

lulz

This is inevitable fate of every egirl, who've already MLULTRA'd themselves by the process of sublimating their tortured digital personas into their real identity. why thot patrolling & tits or GTFO posters is good karma; abusing them is, too. an atmosphere of fear is necessary.

works every time, and funny thing is it just makes the other girls watching more attracted to you; when you exhaust one, you can easily move to next. they'll usually remain obsessed w u for a long time after as a kind of obedient husk if u give them lil attention every so often

And in public, we return to female intercompetition; pitting them against other women: humiliate them by ignoring them to flirt with others, striking right at their heart, as punishments for contrived misbehavior; stripped of public dignity & then treat them like trash for it

This is the point where you can really begin to torture them, and ironically the method is simply by entering the mindset of a woman, roleplaying a woman: emotionally unstable, 
hormonal, very sweet when positive, when negative - incredibly cruel, self-gaslighting, stubborn

The classic cycle of abuse works beautifully as a blueprint to follow once you have them vulnerable, pushing them through highs and lows, forcing all responsibility on them to smash their ego & make them fully insecure, fully devotional; they enter the "wifey" sublimation stage. pic.twitter.com/YuXqmD8bnf

Once the attraction is instilled, you can begin making more committed preference, and push them to open up to you - achieved easily with the threat of the others who still desire you. Their vulnerability is the goal, it gives you the tools to control them.

Their competition can easily be cultivated into a feedback loop if you deftly cycle between the options, granting public attention to each unpredictably, never settling, coaxing them all deeper; the more they fight each other for you, the more they become deeply attracted to you

The female psyche is wired for intergender competition; the most efficient way to psychically abuse a woman, to torture and belittle her, is to subvert her instinctual competitiveness. Once one woman in the community is attracted to you, the rest will start to compete...

Female attraction is viral; they're attracted to status (proxy of both genetic fitness & long-term reliability), and one of the major heuristics they intuit status is by social consensus - they're attracted to people other women are attracted to.

This is also why the easiest way to topple or coup any community is to go straight for the women; it's not that women lead any community, but indirectly they hold the influence, especially over any egoistic, powerhungry mods who are the biggest roadblock to a take over.

In a chatroom, the flow of discourse revolves entirely around the females present, as the majority energy will be their beta orbiters. When you (surreptitiously) control All the women in the chat, you have complete power over the entirety of the community

I used to keep a "trans-friendly" server, very best material for chaotic emotion. Mere presence of hot egirls is enough to induce deep insecurity as the beta orbiters inevitably ignored them. Yet, no deeper resentment can be found than in the GIRL picked over for a tr&nny.

When you have a harem of egirl slaves, infantilized mindbroken women who wait for your order to sleep, to eat; you can play a lot of high-level manipulation games, use them like pawns in chess. Truly it is the endgame of discord, trolling at god-level play. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1228385351762235392 …

The genuine gay underground had little to do with the LGBT movement, or gay marriage, etc. This was astroturfed onto them, and most still have no solidarity with lesbians, bisexuals, etc.; hate women, afraid of immigrants & muslims. They just want to party for god's sake.

lmao

this is not a take, I'm just explaining trans hermeneutics

Yes, many, but these aren't "femboys", they're just not fully transitioned; many still publicly pass w/o surgery. Femboys are girly boys, dont have dysphoria but aesthetically transition partly or fully for sexual and/or fashion reasons. usually shift freely between girl/boymode.

reposting in here bc theory unpacking isn't worth a QT tbh

Committed gender dysphoria is assumed to transmogrify the soul to a woman's; physical body merely lagging behind the metaphysical. Thus qualitatively separated from other categories of gender play, they can invert TERF crit: how can we be patriarchal when we're literally women??

why are you always so passive aggressive

lmaoo

normies only understand memes; the reach is getting wider and these posters on the fringes of our network and have only been partially initiated, carrying a meme that rejects mainstream “white” for some nuanced attempt at differentiated ethnicity, not yet hit topwit synthesis

Yeah I know, I’m just baiting him into unblocking under the assumption he’s reading these

Feel like I could dig one of those out in the yard. It’s just a dug in yurt, really... glass yurt.

When I saw that “U said the white word!” reply I knew u were gonna blow ur lid lol

I think he’s scared :-(

if he’s not the simp then no I’ve no idea who “zeren” is but he blocked w no interact so he’s obv scared of me, ambiently “mogged” by Miya splash damage it wud seem

after she reactivated she DMd me to apologize 4 her bf’s behavior and then I put her in the harem gc LOL

wait is this the simp who sperged all over main after I made the egirl he was dating have a meltdown and deactivate during the egirl tourney

I’m still having trouble understanding the social dynamics here. I really just want more engagement - more replies and back & forths, not just likes or empty dunks. thinking I might clean up the TL and go back into “posting only, no reading the feed” mode.

Yes I noticed that when I first got you to accept me; you don’t seem that unstable otherwise though so I don’t understand why they started talking about psychopathy or whatever

Sure, when I was smaller I used planted bait in gc’s, alt sockpuppets & privately coaxed bigger ppl into being attack dogs; but, besides in the egirl comp’s direct war, my only goal’s been chaos, shaking up the sedimented social hierarchy for its own health. Whatever does the job

I stan my friends too when they fight outsiders. I wanted to jump into whatever fight u were in with Ed and I think kageyura? But I couldn’t figure out what was going on

Oh.

wait ru dating jared. Oh

but also made me realize more than 50% of my mutuals are meme mutuals - i like collecting the followbacks of random egirls, ppl with chinese in bio, kpop stans, djs/artists etc. - tho i didnt unfollow any of them, love em, i like to think im indirectly influencing them

Yea

even in hs I knew theory read as anything other than fiction was for losers

This is also why "why u mad tho?" is universally effective double down on any TrueTroll; the reason they are mad IS the fact they are mad: they resent themselves for getting mad. Resentment is of course what defines their present feeling: "why u self-hating tho?" is the real Q.

what is “non stan film twitter”. I read cinema 12 in hs. What theorycucks need is Shaviro, he is only one to extend Deleuze’s analysis into contemporaneity; the theory nerds are trapped in a futurist vision 40 yrs old

heh

lol

FYI i follow ALL miya stans ONLY IF their following/follower ratio is positive. cant have #miyagang lacking. reply if u a stan & im not following

FYI the algorithm is hiding people from my feed, so I'm gonna be trimming my following list. first with ppl who broke mutual but also random moots i dont recognize; but my memory is bad and the algo has been hiding ppl from me, so reply or dm if we interact & I'll refollow

lol

not me though

Tbh, it's not as hard to pick up as it seems. Just an unintuitive UI and missing tutorial; follow a handholding first fort guide and you'll see all the mechanics build elegantly on top of each other, following a distinct internal logic.

FYI, it's Fingal's Cave off Scotland's coast.

The adventure mode IS the game. Fortress mode is just a mini game they knocked out on the side. The entire thing is just a generator for live & abandoned dungeons to explore in adventure mode.

Of course it is, it's easier than doing it by hand + RNG as they do now; it's a problem of mindset. The problem is, we haven't seen any real videogames yet, just 4 decades of imitating other mediums.

 https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1229513410900922368?s=20 …

Dwarf Fortress isn’t complete yet, won’t be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.

Until then I encourage you to murder any “indie” devs you meet.

Dwarf Fortress, in contrast, models its world first, economy on top of it, and from economy its agent-motivations are derived. Toady understands this, that player plays the algorithm, not the "game" the algorithm manifests; such that even its history generator is often "played".

What do you think the real game of Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? No, it simulates trucking economics. Yet it's dumb, hardcoded economics, a psuedo-algorithm; the players only engage with a gilded interpretation of it.

Sim games wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm yet no deep algorithm is present; only simulating interaction with the world, yet world is still just an arcade.

Simulation is the heart of video games, the undiminished process illuminating an internal algorithm.

This is why Noctis IV is first game ever made, and Dwarf Fortress is the first playable game. Rest are masquerades-including "sim games", which are only simulacrum of simulation. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1229495023479115776 …

I ask these kids what specifically are they upset about and they STFU, never expected me to take them seriously and actually entertain a discussion cuz normal clouttards run the fuck away from any and all confrontation.

I think problem is small accts are traumatized by big account’s cowardice, clout as a shield, they always bout to pull the “u just trying to be relevant; w/e loser” card, so lil guys take these weak potshots like pic related even tho I respond to everyone’s question or complaints  https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1229195771192336386 … pic.twitter.com/RVsQ7fOGUE

why are u upset

Don’t even care about the stupid social hierarchy they’re desperately trying to maintain Im just itching for a fight, I want to see blood

been baiting any of the big accounts to take me on this whole last week, this thread included, & they literally won’t, lmao. keep talking about me in gc’s, dm mutuals to block me, but can’t start ANY shit on main. They’re pathologically afraid of punching in their weight class

This motherfucker single handily destroyed the “fediverse” open sauce anti censorship twitter thru relentless hyper aggressive schizo larping.

And yes, ofc we mog them so effortlessly because we’re the fountain of content they so desperately try to emulate, the golden age of poster they try so hard to be, without trying. We were literally their handlers, they’re the leftover useful idiots we forged a half decade ago.

Ofc it wouldn’t be so easy if they actually had a conscious bone in their body, not acting as mere ideologue, non-commericalized grifter, algorithmic foot soldier bearing an surface aesthetic of edge. This is the subject twitter breeds, just as reddit breeds the limp conformist.

Now that I’ve been here awhile, it’s obvious the majority of “clout” accts have just been here a long time, they’re as low iq and low quality as the average poster, just longer term investment in greasing socialization. No wonder they’re so fucking tilted at our mogging them

Cant even blame them, clouttards unironically consider successful dogpiling, who gets more likes on the dunk, as a proxy of victory; of course all public “argument” is rhetorical, but can’t even achieve strong horse with wit & run from all confrontation can’t win democratically.

there’s definitely shift in clout dynamics based purely on follower count/ratio. Big accounts only feel responsible responding to crit from bigger accounts, otherwise they just hide and pretend they didn’t see it; small accounts flip out & hide thinking u trying to dogpile them. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1229117319894446081 …

Post face

You said “trap is a trashy word to describe feminine boys”, and the OP post is insult enough, traps will always be hotter than u bc they aren’t mentally ill. Sorry

Yeah whatever gayboy, point is trap is not the same thing as femboy or just a slur

Traps don’t hide anything, they just stem from “prison gay” communities; their partners are usually otherwise straight. Femboys come out of the LGBT community; traps usually hate the LGBT.

No. Femboys are a separate category than traps; femboy are just girlish, play with feminine aesthetics, but traps literally try to pass off as a girl, same as a mtf does but without any dysphoria; though not an autogynephilic fetish, just a full expression of twink homosexuality

Glad you’re okay

Most often I dream about reading things on the internet

These dreams I don’t realize they’re a dream & not a daytime memory until I stop to consider them, then it feels like some of my memory, of more mythic world, is stolen from me. reminded me of other memory, chamber in the north w tall statue of bearded warrior, covered in moss

Dreamt about great egyptian tomb under neighborhood in Dresden, entrance air bombed & paved over WW2, hidden;but known earlier. location id’d thru old news clipping & local anons coordinated breakin on live /x/ thread,sledge hammer thru apt stairwell floor reveal great chamber...

In a few hours

depends on society tbh. 14 was normal in depression era America due to the circumstances, but ~16 was probably more universal. Puberty also appears to shift between societies, is occurring earlier in west these days due to nutrition changes. I use lower boundary 2 be inflammatory

when they marry

What the law /should/ be is against any man who sleeps with a woman outside marriage, with marriage requiring father’s consent (grandpa, uncle etc in case of death). Ppl will signal for hours against grooming & pedophiles & sluts, but not this, they don’t want the responsibility

I argue it would; right now the duty of patriarch has been outsourced to the state, removing that puts it back on them - no excuse. Similar thing happens w driving laws, people feel secure knowing they follow the laws, drive with less awareness than they do when laws r removed.

Did you traddies ever stop to think just How great grandpa managed to have 12 kids? Obviously he started grandma pumping them out at 14 or 15. She wasn’t waiting to “finish maturing” with her college diploma before being ready to “settle down”. lol

Yes

This attitude that by simply waiting few extra years, the father’s responsibly to groom his own daughter and evaluate her husband, who will take over her grooming, is absolved is what leads to them being groomed by unscreened predators. Dads are at fault. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1228456632264249344 …

lmao. What is your doubt, sandeep

Massive cope. Late breeding results in less offspring due to a smaller window; past ~30 fertility begins to get damaged, causing birth complications and autistic defects.

exactly. Also it’s more efficient just to find friends who are experts at the thing u aren’t and listen to them/ask them what u wanna know. Tryna do it all on ur own is youthful hubris, can’t mog em all

I happen to have better taste and more knowledge I n many fields I don’t discuss here than anyone here but I’m not gonna bother going down those departments cept on the occasion it comes up. Why ppl always ask me how I know everything about everything, I only talk what I know

By professional host, I mean someone who knows how to prompt a guest(s) and arbitrate the discussion so it proceeds efficiently and towards interesting areas. They need not inject themselves into the mix at all. It is a similar function to a good documentarian or reporter.

4 hour podcasts are for people working in the fields, out with their hands, idling the time, surrounded by foreign coworkers. If they had a higher IQ, more personal agency, they'd be listening to audiobooks. By committing to that audience, you commit to mediocrity

Depends on the structure of production. If unscripted, amateurly coordinated conversation, it will take long time. Professional hosts who know how to lead a conversation has no trouble cutting to the chase; and a lone monologuer with a script need not bother.

hm based lol. i think overattentiveness, false praise w children is more of a problem in america, the impression i get, further east u go, the more they have the secretly-attentive 'let him learn by hurting himself' attitude. builds more balanced ego

they say eel is good for male sexual power

I always thought 20 minutes is a much better format for podcast; not from the perspective of consumption, but production. The content of most 1 hour long podcasts could be read, if rendered to text and "uhhs" cut, in ~10 minutes. 20m only forces refined material, no content lost.

i dont believe in putting kids art on the fridge, my folks didnt. kids dont praise to pursue fun; seems dysfunctional to instill pride for something not deserving or requiring it, w it comes corollary of insecurity - won't think: is this bad? if they never thought the other good.

i thouht you said you felt too cringe to type like a dumb cutesy girl

I will, however, approve of and promote any and all flattery, praise and veneration directed towards me

my policy is i dont ever give undeserved approval, but with the people who look up to me, I'll withhold negativity id otherwise levied, be more delicate, be more lenient with my approval; because I know it means more. but never encourage their cringe until they transcend it

The only thing an AOC law does besides lower birth rates is make the father feel secure in abandoning his daughter; allowing him to isolate responsibility for her negative grooming or manipulation only when it offends law, or a large age difference, free to ignore her destruction

You aren't listening. No woman is immune to seduction. She is not capable of any decision, its always outsourced to the father figure; who may be the seducer himself; the most she can do is sublimate her father figure into State agitprop to sabotage possible relationships.

No. It's important for women to have their partner's chosen wisely, as they give themselves up entirely to him. For men not important, just genetically fit. If her father isn't choosing for her, any man that desires her can easily claim her; he may be good or bad, she won't know.

Yep, progressivism replaces father's patriarchy with the State. The weakling, low test males subjugated by their own wives fear taking back the responsibility.

It's partially true, but not to "minorities". The problem is they're host to a subversive parasite that exploits certain "altruistic" high trust assumptions that uphold functioning civilization; there isn't really a solution beyond genocide, bc high trust is necessary. lol

No, more, far more; but it's not her choice, but her father's. I don't mean this as what it "should" be, I mean that's what it is; if her father isn't choosing for her, then it'll simply be up to the man that takes interest in her and plays the role of her missing father.

Do not be sophistic. I'll rephrase only once more: bourgeois conception of emotional maturity is binary 'some years following physical maturation, a woman's mental maturation is complete, only then ready for marriage'. Wrong. Development is ongoing, and contingent on marriage.

your butt sucks but your nose and cheek profile are good

the idea that there is a binary "emotional maturity" point that is passed at AOC, where one can be said to be "emotionally mature" as they are physically mature. It is ongoing, as is spiritual and intellectual maturity, only arguably completes towards the end of ones life.

inflammation is a proxy of ideological distance

As time attests, these issues fall away with resources. A king earns himself a harem, having the means to support 100 sons. this is natural law. His only requirement is being able to manage the emotions of the wives; and in modernity, the seethe of a slave-run society.

yes he does lmao, its the crux of his argument. read the first essay in on the genealogy of morals

Unknown. At that level things only reach public record when it's chosen to. He had stated plans for mass impregnation. Some offspring may pop up to try and claim his inheritance.

The only reason pseudo-traddies are so threatened by dismantling feminist age of consent laws is because they know their grip on their own children as father of the household is too weak to actually prevent their daughters from getting groomed by an unsuitable unapproved husband.

If you're a Christian, yes. If you're a true Aryan, you would have done exactly as Epstein did if you had is means, existing as an effectively sovereign king. It is the first Natural law that great men spread their seed as far and wide as possible.

True trad protocol, relying on LT societal preservation as the barometer of morality, and time-tested heuristics as the method of societal preservation, clearly and logically points to marriage as early is reproduction allows; even true within Christianity; as our natural desire.

they literally do not have an argument against this. The "debate" is a performance dancing around the fact they are ideologically noncommittal, reversing back to materialist modernist atheism the moment its boundaries are actually tested. Yawn

The "Underage Question" eternally debated by conservatards & tradlarps on twitter is funny cope cuz the fact it's debated already answers the question. If God didn't want u fucking 14 year old girls, why he make em hot? why all ur ancestors did it? why their biology croon for it?

Thomas Cleary's translation of art of war is best btw.

its online here. click into his citations for full context
 https://web.mit.edu/~dcltdw/AOW/toc.html …

for anyone aspiring for success in the workplace, however, by far best book u can read & internalize is 'the unwritten laws of engineering'. following it alone will make you worth 6 figures, basic productive competency is rarity today. Art of war is for exec level blood politics

I am suspect same as you though that military success is largely flanking + luck; large scale battle is incredibly complex and wars are mainly won by logistics. however, the battlefield is also the best metaphor for conflict, present in all aspects of life; bountiful study

for the same reason being a student of history in general will always be to your advantage. Though milhistory is always best. art of war is one of the best ones though, 7 mil classics overall good; 36 stragems also good; clausewitz' on war, jomini's study on napoleon

War is a form of politics; military strategy always translates easily to government politics, corporate politics, individual politics; because they're the same thing. Some, like Clausewitz, goes much deeper into the real logistics, but none of the knowledge is unbeneficial

not that its irrelevant, though from a business perspective Frederick the Great's Anti-Machievel is a more applicable argument; the state taken as metaphor for the corporation.

Most people who recommend these books as biz self help dont actually read them BTW. The Prince, for example, is not the strong embodiment of individualistic "machiavellianism" they actually meant to suggest you when they recommend it; it argues a philosophy of government

Some commentators have noted my mogging on twitter embodies strategems of art of war; this is true, and I wudnt destroy everyone so effortlessly if they actually understood the lessons/warnings held within

very worthwhile. When people says it has "common sense", what the mean is some of its sayings have become cliche; but not having actually read it, don't understand the strategems integrate as a system. Most people have not at all internalized sun tzu, relevant to any pol strat

Jealousy gets sublimated into the harem dynamic. The intense, psychotic jealous found in modern “monogamous” extra-marital relationships is dysfunctional, product of the unnatural arrangement

Take the yuripill, the CIA was subverted by the reds which lead them to push modernism’s marxist demoralization propaganda, psychological self sabotage. The soviets were the ones who baited America into a culture war in the first place, claiming inheritance to European culture.

why

Eishin Campus outside Tokyo, by Christopher Alexander. At one time, postmodernism was at a fork between his traditional urbanism and Peter Eisenman’s deconstructivism; the world went with the latter. New urbanism” is confusedly stumbling back to what Alexander already codified.

If scientists had any bones left they’d be digging into these reports very seriously. America is ancient, wild country; even now lots of the country hasn’t been inspected by man in a long time, lots of many-acred hiding places; to speak nothing of paranormal. we know very little.

To avoid the court of intrigue is to commit to irrelevance, to bow out from society itself. A man wants power, nothing else. Are you a man? https://twitter.com/TrumpyWumpyDump/status/1227681639347707906?s=20 …

I do know of one noble exception, but it's one you don't like. It's the outlaw, the pirate, the underworld. Your only other alternative is quiet self-exile, hiding in the shadows of Empire. Tell yourself its a victory all you want, you're the real king: no one's listening anyway.

Corporate capitalism has largely sublimated war in modernity as the resource-organizing parallel of politics; corporations exist as internal States, its CEO's as kings (or republics), and the directors as lords. You, mere worker, are will always be a subject to something.

As if a man is only a lord if he is the sovereign king of a state; yet even a king is subject to God.

Capitalist space is also, outside of politics, one of only places you will ever have real dominion over other men. A working stooge will never be leader of anything other than his children, maybe his wife; yet will cope against his boss with knowledge his boss has a boss.

It's mere cope for their inability to enter or excel in the corporate court-room; the only real space left in modernity for genuine competitions of power, abstracted violence, outside of politics itself; a game as old as money itself: riding the great dragon of capitalism.

Modern slaves scoff at the suit & tie: "see how it is metaphor for strangled neck. Me noble savage, free to dress in jeans & graphic tee!" Yet decorum is the aesthetic expression of discipline, and discipline the foundation of any military. Your warrior ancestors see you as dirt.

What do you think your great general ancestors did during peacetime, camped out in city barracks? Bureaucracy is the lifeblood of empire as politics are of courts, and they could never achieve high position without either. Man did spend his days in marble office, peasants didn't.

"Man was not made to sit at office all day" & yet this has been the lives of elites since the dawn of agriculture; man, too, wasn't meant to break back in the fields, as you do. The office is not a prison, but a royal court: realm of intrigue & politics. It's elite for a reason.

Obviously stems from resentment for their superiors; they hate the suit bc it represents wealth & privilege. It is no coincidence the anti-corporate man meme is also paired with mutterings of nepotism and bureaucratic corruption: "they don't deserve it, I do, life is so unfair.."

Lot of traddies like to swipe at the low hanging fruit shitting on corporate boys as shackled slaves: "observe how they're forced to wear suit uniform, how they are trapped to office during sunlight hours, is it not like prison!" Let me address this misguided slave moralism.

Dumb meme, feudal lords are not slaves just because they are subject to a king.

Slaves will cry about "wageslaves" not understanding salaried men are paid on value added, not hours worked; the wageslaves will cry about inefficiency, not understanding this is a necessary and rightful role that they too could take if only they had the character for lordship.

Few understand this is corporate work's equilibrium state, the body become merged with machine as a totem around which work-flows are distributed to more worldly "working" bodies, 1 degree separated by hands-on managers: the director is a rock, a passive overseer, a feudal lord. https://twitter.com/redditships/status/1227652601765924864 …

What most people experience as "modern architecture" is just kitsch of High Modernism, and what e-traddies want to return to is a kitsch of classicalism; I could not think of a more postmodern wish. Tradition is not reconstructing decoration, it's rediscovering eternal forms. pic.twitter.com/tSoGhZB3Zo

Great crime of modernists wasn't that they were materially austere, not that they shorned the "decorative", certainly not that they were atheistic, rejecting the spirituality of architecture. It was hubris: they thought they could elevate man with their art, and failed trying.

Ulysses et al are right, you know; neoclassicalism is a bourgeois fetish, kitsch on par wit "hipster rusticism"; their misinformed aesthetic sense is evidenced by conflation of architectural modernism, in all its indulgence, with neoliberal efficiency, mere parking lot austerity. https://twitter.com/olagjean/status/1225935906332401665 …

Sometimes when I eat my Friday rare steak I imagine I am eating into the throat of my enemies. I have dreams of spear hunting elk, probably vision of a past life I bet, and one day I would like to KILL the yaris b*tch who cut me off two years ago. This is my fantasy.

We're all traditionalists here, we all recognize the inherent hierarchy of man and nature as whole, we reject inequality, we mock the modern "flatitude"; Yet still, you reject my right to slay a man? You reject even my right to slay a woman and her 2 children? Does it make sense?

I've tried to uncover info on trad seating in the West; seems to have been kept orally, lost in modernity. Planned seating is resented now—even children are seated with adults, let alone women. Only record I can find seats all on same side of table, head in exact center. Curious.

There is an extreme delicacy in the arrangement of gender to a seating plan. An improper balance can make or break the conversation. Most often, the solution is simply: strict segregation. Anything else is a delicate art.

Curiously, the arrangement is reversed in the all-male business meeting. The most heads, and most important guests, are seated directly in the middle, with least important descending towards the ends. What could this mean?

At a feast, the male head of the table has male to his right hand, woman to left; female head has the opposite. Women sit across from their partner; their adjacent alternates: man, woman, man. In other cases, women are sat in other room, with the children (incl. the unmarried).

What is the perfect dinner seating arrangement protocol? In islamic world, the two heads sit facing opposite at both ends of table, beside them the most important guests, descending downwards in parallel; least important at the exact middle. Perhaps this is perfect? @wrathofgnon

when I don't have work for him I've him do remote medical transcription for $15/hr USD, and I tell him to take english class in afternoon before his work day (night) - he's more than happy to at that salary. Leaves me at annual net positive ~$18K, with only room to grow. Not bad

Just hired a full-time personal assistant for $1,000 USD annual. He's in pakistan, but I told him he needs to sleep in the day and work in the night (more than happy to at THAT salary).

Impression I get is majority of India's foreign capital inflow is a national swindle hinged on miscalibrated foreign perception of their real productivity. He seemed v excited to have figured this out, saw opportunity for arbitrage with his "spy system". I let him pay the bill.

When the management is in on it, the whole thing gets sour, he said. Common trick, hire 2 people to do one man's job. He'll do the work and report it for both, share a cut of their salary while they never show up, off working other jobs, perhaps even on same gambit - endlessly.

He told me that he'd estimate probably 50% of the "operations" in India are a "ghost office". The whole office from manager down cheating, reporting low productivity but really just never showing up except when foreign management comes in town. You gotta know how to manage them.

He told me how the problem is they need "people infrastructure". If you look the other way, they'll all cheat the big dumb American. For every 3 coders, he has a "spy", pretending to code, but actually "just a narc". He says you need "layers", otherwise they'll cheat you too.

Had oysters with a suit from Chicago last night. Was transitioning into IT. He told me for the salary of one "red-blooded" (?) American, he could get 10 "bodies" in India. Double that in Pakistan, but you have to "cover the trail" from India. Anyone know what he's talking about?

They're cut from the same fake & gay cloth as the wiccan pagan WN tradlarpers and will NOT ascend into aryastate

Yes but ex-atheist converts interpret their rediscovered Christianity in same materialist lens; lack any genuine sense of mystery, communion with the superworldly, revelation of realness of the unknown. In place of true veneration of god there is only social, rationalized "faith"

The more accurate formulation probably would've been: "what makes his "christianity" any different from an atheist with faith... only theology is anti-atheism!"

This is a good response, though I don't think it's shared by  average western/online Christian, I consider spiritual atheists. & I disagree, I find this mystery most strongly in aryan tradition and am suspect most Christian mysticism is in truth accreted relics of roman paganism.

My point was it didn't refute the claim you were tasked with refuting, only addressed WN but not atheism.

I don't deny it, I've argued for ethnic transmogrification as well. The material and spiritual are in unison, and both are malleable; this understanding is the heart of aryan paganism. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1156616892397654016 …

Lack of faith in genetics and belief in race as spiritual is a progressive position strongly held by post-protestant atheism, who will gladly tell you race is cultural. You've only revealed yourself to be an atheist of the liberal persuasion

Is it really a surprise that its only in furthest, most extreme advance of modernity, in its deepest heart, it unravels, opening up to ancient, eternal mores? Did you really think rejection performed within the State's provisioned boundaries will achieve more than those outside?

The illegal rave is a Dionysian revelry, Bakhtin's carnival; anonymity IRL. Drugs are just a material catalyst; as black money is in other underworlds, who replicate ancient warrior-culture heirarchies, or close-knit village systems, or feudalistic slavery.

The underworld isn't attractive because of the hedonism of drugs or edginess of secrecy; it's autonomy. It offers an exit from the State's oppressiveness, its will-to-slavery. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1226674797561516033?s=20 …

I didn’t advocate anything ITT I just defined “underworld”

To understand miya you must understand I am the most well read person on twitter. I have simply reached the stage where I’ve transcended citation and internalized all theory; it subsists literally only in sly puns and obscure jokes, if not borrowed constructions.

Yes, and I am; I hint to it using the phrase temporary lawless zones, or Burroughs’ “interzone”. It’s no coincidence that BAP’s underworld, Burroughs’ interzone and Bey’s TAZ all share the same major example: the pirate utopia. Few understand this. https://twitter.com/DoctorToosoon/status/1226918629268217856 …

Where have I hated on BAP? Nothing I’ve said contradicts his own appraisal of the underworld in BAM.

It’s the black market, the extra-state, where new internal “shadow” laws, codes and languages are loosely defined to ensure order, and tested against three principles of secrecy, accomplice and amorality. It’s not weed and Netflix or candy flipping at an EDM rave.

The underworld is deals done in the dark, the masked gathering, ethnic quarter where cops don’t enter; it’s the lawless interzone, where presence makes you outlaw and the distinction between civility, misdeamonor and felony is conflated; a stabbing is as possible as offered coke.

Forgot how incredibly dumb normie frogtwit is; even if I get blackpilled by my own 6K network, it still sits at precipice of an iceberg of literacy. Ulysses’ method, troll by inverting their class anxiety, worked beautifully but point on underworldism remains misunderstood. Read: https://twitter.com/ManifestMelanin/status/1226812289979842560 …

Learn to read. I suggested illegality from the state is essential to the underworld, drugs are just one example.

Exactly; all the people commenting how they spent their 20s high and couchlocked watching Rick & Morty to prove the underworld experience is worthless are just as divorced from it, and life itself, as those who spent them alone in their room arguing about politics. https://twitter.com/catamitesniffer/status/1226868184977944576 …

yes. it didn’t have a name just something people did

Oh my bad misread your angle; there were multiple posts in that vein just picked one to make my point. In any case, repeat ODs doesn’t speak to the question of addiction being psychological/neurological or physical, latter of which the OP was refuting.

Preying on their anxieties and turning the tables on their criticism works exactly to create sensationalist bait that they inevitably boost with ”dunks”, indirectly proliferating the second-layer payload, my real point. You must be new to miya posting

I agree, see it as a horseshoe, full urbanism parallels full ruralism; the sidewalk hobo is equivalent to the mountain man, genuine survivalists, and the inner city ghetto approximates a village network. knew kids in hs who did summer hobo challenge, always respected that.

The simplification is a troll, or rather piggybacking off an obvious troll, to make the main point of the thread about underworldism; the OP punchline is just a jab at pervasive addiction, not commentary on its nature. Go ahead an elaborate on your understanding, I’m listening

I’ve never commented on Revolt here, but yes I’ve read it, and, further, I understand it better than you do.

I don’t advocate living underworld, but anyone who can’t survive contact with it, excel within it if needed, is not the RW chad-ubermensch they desperately want to be; and that they haven’t and can’t is evidenced by their naive puritanism.

For women, I’m not sure if there is even any line between sociopathy and performance. I think their sociopathy might be performed as much as their performance is sociopathic.

Cocaine is not physically addictive, it has no mechanism of physical dependence. the popular theory of addiction that assumes most or all drugs are related to physical dependency is incorrect; it mainly relates to pavlovian habit formation, which can be overcome with willpower.

Yes they have. You need rub the tears out of your eyes and read more slowly. There is nothing more I can tell you.

Yes, read it again. They've all been addressed. You need to read more slowly.

Rub the tears out of your eyes, scroll up and reread everything slowly this time.

It's been explained and you've already gone and dug up the backing evidence, only thing I can't do is teach you to read it. Please try your best.

Take a few years to compare definition of physical dependence you found against the studies you've pulled up. Google words you don't recognize, then piece them together in complete sentences. Try to draw a meaningful conclusion. Take it slow. Until then, this conversation is over

Keep digging you'll make the connection

google physical dependence then google addiction theory.

Note this applies to all 4 studies you pointlessly linked. Learn to actually read them, this isn't wikipedia.

lmao did you even read what you linked or just post the first thing that came up? To put it simply, they're illuminating part of structural changes present in transition to habitual use; it speaks nothing to physical dependence- is even against it by pointing to neural pathways.

... enough that even self-aware of the mechanisms and actions of their manipulation (inevitable if they're high IQ and rationally-minded enough to be effective; can very well often be only in reflection), they're low conscience enough to accept it as an agreeable course of action

True ASDP is characterized by other factors not present in the colloquial understanding "sociopath" - namely high impulsiveness, disinhibition & aggression. But yes, the "psychopath", cold, calculating, manipulative American Psycho power-seeker is just high IQ & low conscience...

Your point is emotive flailing

Sociopathy to normies is not about any "machiavellianism", immoral, absolute selfishness. It's just effective selfishness ("calculating"). In their low IQ fog, they can only ever identify it when self-awareness is admitted; or projected, when you dodge their own dumb manipulation

Average normie pathologically manipulates on a daily basis, they abuse each other mercilessly, are intensely selfish, w total insincerity in their performed emotions—unconsciously, entirely unbeknownst to them. The difference in a sociopath is simply in efficacy & self-awareness.

The times I'm most often accused of sociopathy by normies is just when cutting through their own mediocre sociopathy: their callous, ugly, poorly achieved seflishness—morals & decorum thrown away the moment its convenient. The idea one might be above that shocks and threatens.

Interesting thing about normies is they think NOT doing things like using the memory of a dead friend to reinforce a flailing dunk just for clout on twitter dot com is a sign of cold & calculating sociopathy. Lol https://twitter.com/Kali_K_priv/status/1226658152369840129 …

They're still underground, in basements and warehouses etc. The public "EDM" "raves" are normie bait, not underworld. the noise/techno complex is the only global post-millenium musical underworld.

there is a kool heirarchy you appear oblivious too, which indicates your place on the bottom rung; no surprise you only knew other losers.

If you’ve never even been flown out just cuz your company’s worth it, Soz you’re not ubermensch, not guru, not alpha not chad, not aryan, you not interesting or entertaining or 6’3.

is that u in pinned tweet??

Suburban nerd read evola quote image on twitter and put “reject modern world” in bio, he never even seen it, Kid it rejected you. Like How u gonna revolt against something revolted by U Lol

They live as “ubermensch” in carefully controlled externally defined conditions that ensure a prescribed safety and order; hoping one day to find a wife to fulfill the conservative fantasy; “ubermensch” because they  control themselves from masturbation more often than not. lol

The vast majority of people, especially those who find themselves on “right wing twitter”, have never been in any “illegal situation”, participant in a banned community activity, such as an illegal rave or party or drug den. They have no conception of underworldism whatsoever.

The impression I get is the tradcaths on twitter are a bunch of pasty suburban post-atheists altright weenies mass memed into it as a cope for the post-election trump blackpill. They don’t seem to have been invested in it very long.

Have a lot of threads I still mean to write but not much time to write them. Im a busy bee, many people to see. These are all posted from the highway, that’s why you rarely see images or textual references attached. Soon enough, though, my work here will be done...

& that’s just foundation for the esoteric conclusion, in synthesis with knowledge of blood-memory, realization that paganism is not just relativist culture, but derived from birth, another manifestation of ethnicity. You didn’t miya was gonna just stop at dunking thiests did you?

The point, btw, wasn’t about Christianity or atheism, it was about paganism; understanding the very alien cosmology of ethnic spiritualities which are too often understood in a theistic lens, the inherent absurdity of calling Hinduism, for example, a religion.

This isn’t even a subject I intended to go into much detail because it’s not a novel thought, it’s been well covered in the literature and is known to anyone with a genuine education in comparative religion or religious history. But man these NPCs have been left far, far behind.

@meta_miya

pagan originates as a Christian term against non-christians, functionally equivalent to infidel or gentile; in the eastern roman empire, the term hellenic was used, of Jews distancing themselves from "pagan" hellenic (greek) culture. there were monotheistic pagan cults.

For those who wonder, my stance on abrahamism. The Christians I countersignal I suspect are not Christians at all, but agents of Satanists; of you-know-who. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1225518869361647616 …

who is this girl

lol

I'm highly skeptical of abrahamism for its deep connections to satanism, occulted history & unreliably preserved texts; I suspect very early on it was hijacked; but am inclined to believe its origins are true & open to possibility that it could've been retained in some tradition.

y u mad tho. ive said nothing about orthodox christianity https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1225510395819053059?s=20 …

this is disputed. almost no first hand literature of chavarkas has survived, everything we can derive about them comes from unsympathetics.

Hindu piety relates to accepting authority of the vedas; the existence of a God as creator of the universe had long been treated with some skepticism, and the representation of deities have always been understood as interchangeable: "theism" is not a conditional element.

The reason why Christians hate to hear that Atheism is Christian sect is because it carries the truth that paganism is a worldview, not a "religion" or a "faith"; a heresy they've worked hard to submerge, that activates dangerous almonds when properly considered. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1222923606771978240 …

do you know how to read

looks like im not the first to say it https://twitter.com/nntaleb/status/738695613051744256?s=20 …

People use mleccha today to refer to foreigners, but true sanskrit meaning is anyone outside the aryavarta, the aryan world, including anyone existing outside the brahmanical spiritual community; including products of caste miscegenation. Content of their alien faiths irrelevant

I will discourse more on atheism as an inherently abrahamic faith another day. I am merely demonstrating how you perform any actual etymological analysis. Widespread illiteracy is a more pressing concern to me than defending the obvious: Atheism is a Christian sect.

It wasn't until the renaissance that "atheism" was defined as its own material faith, rejecting entirely the existence of God-and then it was clear this rejection of the one, Abrahamic God, that "adevism" was eventually coined for rejection of the pluralistic deities of paganism. pic.twitter.com/X0F982wQcT

Atheos is not simply "without theism". It referred to a rejection of the local gods, because the gods were the world itself, not a "faith". It referred to heathenism: it referred to Christians. Christians, too, used atheos as the pejorative it was. pic.twitter.com/PC9GtPhp3x

Midwit illiteracy has them use definitions make semantic arguments, not understanding meaning's in use: in etymology. Sometimes when they reach it, they still treat it a definition: literal, contextless. See this common retort by illiterate christians denying atheism is christian pic.twitter.com/m11tnMp4yZ

Occasionally I get cautious dm's from people who recognize my mannerisms, ask if im X alt from another community. They tell me how they still talk about me, years have passed, yet trolls still LARP me, betas still accuse each other of being me in disguise. This is rent-free.

i am curious on your conversion, assumed you were always cath. do you have any posts detailing the path that lead you here

True rent-free means traumatization, ideally of the collective psyche of a community, such that even with months past since you last graced them, the mere mention of your name causes them to revert to defensive paranoia, or unhinged rage, depending on the character of your abuse. https://twitter.com/blauer_geist/status/1225489517152477189 …

This is the etymological root, not its history. Try looking a little more closely.

It's not as simple as we can't make roman concrete, some of Aristotle's books we only know by reference. All of even the last millenium that is not only lost, but unknown to us that is lost, far outstrips the little we do know is missing. We live cleaved of history.

People speak of library of Alexandria, but history is a catalogue of little tragedies. frail knowledge held in secret oral traditions and eccentrics' personal libraries; a tiny slice to survive the violent upheavel of modernity. Almost all Known today comes from last 100 years.

Don’t disagree, “high caste” is the catchall. Have noted elsewhere emphasized virtues in nobility is not ethnically homogenous, though there are constants - eg IQ, time pref - and not all will necessarily reflect competitiveness on world market equally.

Comes down to mixed up breeding patterns and volatile markets tbh. Fallen nobles born a pauper becoming a millionaire, going broke and back again, multiple times in their life, is common story in big cities. Wealth more often lost in divorce than failed investments.

not really. they more or less recover within 3 generations. I use "caste" and not "class" to acknowledge that they're not strongly tied, as they were in traditional past.

material background. lot of high caste families have ended up impoverished in modern volatility.

is this a kpop girl

there's a reason why art production is reserved for the elite

from experience, high IQ, high caste people don't need to try very hard to make money regardless of family background - "lucky" opportunities are everywhere, they're just better at utilizing them. some work hard but it's more likely than not for their own pleasure.

im gonna raise my kids on slackware though. its good to learn the workings of a machine in its simpler construction before you move to its a more advanced, incomprehensible one. same reason you start off on an old junk car you can work on.

w10 for work, osx on mbp for shitposting, obsd on couple thinkpads for various set&forget autisms. any1 installing linux to browse a GUI is inconveniencing themselves for larp or 2poor2afford OSX. bsd is good 4 optimizing old hardware & cwm; kb based navigation most efficient

and yet you have yet to address where I am incorrect

this is why unix, eg openbsd, is good, offers a machine cleanly & principally organized that you can hack in way you want. linux is a confused, uncontrolled accretion of amateurism ultimately resulted in systemd's black box; which is why only slackware gets a pass.

your pedantics have focused in on wrong word, instead of emulation, which was used as a euphemism. perhaps you are confused because you are upset

no lol. unironic vanilla OSX is topwit. linux is midwit, unix is the true path

good taste. chink shit and thinkpad are best generals

linux is for weenies. openbsd is goat. slackware based 2

i am incapable of thinking of jungle and all contemporary uk beat as not cringe

(u misread my shorthand)

dimwit: windows
midwit: linux
topwit: osx

tf you browsed /g/?

what is this

breakbeat being reduced to a sampled novelty is a confirmation of its irrelevancy, and techno stagnation despite domination of global underground confirms its status as the final genre. 50 years from now people will still be emulating 808303s to start a rave, but not CDJs.

UK "deconstructed" club is ultra irrelevant btw lol. no one even pretends to care about it except for anglophone posers in Berlin and black drag queens

how am i incorrect. jungle is cringe tekno is eternal

do you still listen to jungle? @Outsideness did you ever goto the Bunker in Xintiandi before it was shut down? the kids still love special K but its saved for noise/techno now... yet no one to pen zines on "sonic brutalism" and "fascist symmetries".... what to do..

Recall old CCRU texts suggesting breakbeat as end of (aural) history; observing eternity in the warped & spliced amen break. Little did they know it was in acid techno's 808 & 303 all along: free tekno remains forever, while UK rhythm has completely recused itself from relevance.

Anglophone internet's unironic disavowal of piracy is the root of its demise: opening way to authorship & "credit", to monetization & assumption "creators" have right to profit, for commitment into clout-based "attention economies", for taking others, let alone themselves, srsly.

ive noticed this too, I think they're stuck in based 1.0 communities: gmod and pirate MMO servers, BBS.

its really shocking how esotericism that was delegated to even the fringes of /pol/ is being memed about casually  now over just a few years

archives?

Yes

idr, as a teen I was into william burroughs, D&G, media theory etc; natural I stumbled into CCRU. i think the first related I read was sadie plant's writing on drugs, actually. lol

I do admit I was surprised to see all you people caught up on my bent after so many years charting my own solitaire, even including my esoteric nutritionalism. Only major pill RW twitter is missing from my early literary cosmology is William S. Burroughs; must do thread on him...

cool

Only his muji tapes; majority of his discography is for either videogames or casual summer films. Hiroshi Yoshimara is the artist dedicated to department stores.

Vivaldi's violin concertos at low volume is very light, engaging only when focused, but unintrusive & right tempo for eating when not. Try it. Country is only music for dives, which are for both lone drinkers & open conversation: either magnet for your blues or bg voice in crowd.

Topwit*

Perhaps it is goal of the music patrician, that premier product of digital era, to take his carefully cataloged genres, his curated libraries & "mood" playlists, and find their every reference against life, every perfect BGM...and on learning it is always "mute", he may be freed.

Recorded music all seeks a context, and some contexts have had theirs figured out. Synth music is best soundtrack to any horror film. Trap is the BGM of heaven’s house party. Country is for dive bars, and Vivaldi’s concertos are for home dinners. These things will never change.

Sometimes i like to think of them as sacrifices to dionysian party gods, a scapegoat to bear the karmic debt for all the positive energy produced by the happening; then I am only a shepherd, a nudge is all they need to know their purpose, the executioner is them and them alone.

Sometimes Im possessed by dark spirit who for a night sways me to his twisted humor. U may observe me whispering into ear of lonely patron, perhaps we disappear for a moment...an hour or 2 later, a commotion: she's screaming on kitchen floor, or he's attempting jump out window...

times I find myself "crashing" house party, slipped thru door w subterfuge, solely to confirm their worst fear: liquor drunk copiously, then, by its own emboldenment, All stolen. 1 to ruin night of 30, escaped into night for a private misery; mind repeating: "I am become wraith!"

I admit my great vice is destroying a dinner party, that scene I cherish so much; one must hurt what they love to know loves boundaries, and Yes, I will get "too drunk" & grope the not-to-be-groped if you, Host, do not fawn me enough, or fawn too much. Perhaps this is resentment?

Thinking about all the dinners I have "ruined" w my practiced brood, lowered gaze's dark-energy rays reaching cross table to extinguish mirth. Is it not my right to call in debt for those occasions I overly regaled w joy & good charms? Great company demands terrible elsewhere...

It’s fully possible; the narrative is in the algorithm, as the most complex play is. Few understand this

Yeah but bianca too though

it’s baffling bap actually tried to cancel you for laughing at this guy

I love soaps lol, I was just explaining the mechanism of GoT’s appeal to Sunny. The only reason I don’t have any interest to GoT is its incompetent execution stands below my standard.

It’s fantasy but low & gritty to utilize the same pulp but under a pretense of serious drama to target midwit intellectual insecurity. If you stan GoT but not TDK, you are a hypocrite, simple as; they’re the same thing.

And I don’t disagree court intrigues is a good trope, which I’ve made no comment on, just pointing out GoT is insultingly bad midwit bait.

It’s a very meaningful critique; GoT is defined by what specific  steps it takes to distance itself from soap stigma, which allowed it to forge a new market, one that is notably midwit. The books’ design are similarly transparent, but hit different notes in its own pulp market.

Howard’s Conan, Burroughs’ Barsoom. On the small screen, what OP describes as GoT’s appeal is best exemplified on not in fantasy but in “historical fiction”, eg West Wing.

Soap opera are tv shows

Its technical production is also offensively bad in pretty much all departments. I think it’s what Borzoi has referred to as normie humiliation rituals.

G&T is just midwit soap opera, its rooted in soap’s thoroughly feminine gossip-drama but detourns it (aka plausibly denies it) thru a fantasy setting, and drops soap’s self-awareness, instead adopting pretentious edge to appeal to same self absorbed normie-geeks who love TDK.

I recall a Sims 3 PC I kept in the basement trained to max level gnome carving, entire house & yard filled with gnomes for sell. Later I would carry a garden gnome in Source Engine from start to end of Half-Life Episode 1 to send on its rocket to space—its hardest achievement.

there is NOTHING to stop me buying goat milks & raw honey from Whole Foods and relabeling as with my own Miya Farm stickers & upselling for 2X. I will hire high schoolers to sit & sell, high schoolers to relabel even, AMZ delivered: dropshipped cells at markets across the nation.

Was disgusted at a saturday “farmer’s market”, bearded cross fitter selling $10/quart chicken “bone broth”, boomer hippie with vegan brownies, endless couples in yogawear bring out their labrador to line up for food truck. And I have concocted plan to destroy it with much profit:

I tell you this as advice for your future twitter endeavors, my old friend, John Sanilac.

The little people are unimportant, they’ll always follow the crowd following the big dogs. I stopped bothering trying to communicate to them a long time ago; they either understand, or cannot. Those who don’t will still follow you, or won’t, either way it is worth nothing.

They’re not simply illiterate, they’re beta midwits too. Baiting a block is a fast tell if they’re beta or alpha; the former, by nature of the ideology, being false impersonators. Despite the pretense, you’ll note the majority are feminized cowards whenever tested a little.

This is the end-game of modernity’s globalism, and the only escape from inevitability is not through ideology or politics, but removing the conditional state in which it arises; a reversion of globalism. As you may know, the cure is a drop of the poison.

 https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1164030964781076482?s=21 … https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1164030964781076482 …

If Gaia does not deliver us our black swan, we will deliver it ourselves - likely in multitude. Luck’s role dwindles as the agency moves from the hands of only God, to only major States, to any State, to any large org, to any terrorist or cult or online extremist.

However, globalism is not merely a political ideology, but a capitalist impetus: interconnectivity is financial catalyst; and a byproduct of its efficiency arms race is lowering the barrier of WMDs. As time goes on, natural chance moves to manmade inevitability.

A deeply consequential viral pandemic could evolve at any time, and globalism provides both the vector for its spread while ideologically removing all barriers; we only survive by luck of its non evolution, as Moldbug details.

Will to gobalism is modernity’s death drive, the heart of progressivism’s soft imperialist ideology. It lays out many extinction events, some black swans which may be missed by luck, some inevitabilities, WMDs reaching hands of man, not State; inevitable as Earth’s long death.

Moldbug’s latest speaks on western media’s absurd response to coronavirus: quarantine rejected as anti-progressive “isolationism”, proving globalist doctrine comes even before self-preservation. This shouldn’t surprise you, that IS the progressive faith. https://americanmind.org/essays/rip-globalism-dead-of-coronavirus/ …

Don’t recommend this btw, still suffering from greatly distorted sense of time

He’s right. “Until they come up with some theory of how a fragile virus can hop from the Old World to the New, without hopping on a plane, there is no point in trying to refute the internationalists. They can only be deconstructed.”

there is a right answer though. all objects do have a spiritual gender, feminine receives, male gives; yin and yang. it is language that is imperfect.

that makes sense

Where does "schmood" even originate? It's not from imageboards, certainly, and I know linguistically it is not from black twitter (too awkward, cringe); the only two sources of valid slang online. In truth, it reeks of ironic leftist podcast.

Hey miya, whatcha thinking about? I'm thinking about "schmood". Anyone who uses "schmood" stands against me. - "schmood" is a verbalization of the crying wojak wearing smug wojak mask meme; I've only ever seen it used by trolled freaks trying to preserve clout by "playing it off"

oh marla, your path has lead you to me and at me it ends

It's called polyadenylation. It's universal in RNA

True "political influence" for the true esoteric means nothing less than gathering a guild-cult around you of loyal followers ascended by their initiations, IRL. The left-hand path interprets this as a sexual harem, probably. The right-hand path? Homeschooling your children.

this was a good joke. logo follow me btw

RW nutritionialism is literally what they mean by unocculting the occulted.

i think its pretty based, its basically a personal cult. imagine if all true-woke online esoterics had an IRL guild/cult behind them, we wud mog the world

vice is exception, he's cool specifically bc he's gathered a genuine guild around him with apparently solid influence/power/connections, a step fake & gay online "magicians" you describe fail to ever reach. only problem is this misunderstood beef w kali acc & yes, a spurned ego

vice has conflated "occult" with "magick". this isnt the first time, and the source of the misunderstanding. kaliacc expounding on the occulted doesn't mean they are claiming to be practicing magicians.

Good conversation is the most important thing in the world, and it is never involves these "people" who speak of themselves through their interior, but of external: things and environments; the self is told by that which revolves around it: the orbiting illuminates the orbited.

the labyrinth of solitude

The idea that conversation should express inner "thoughts", a unique "perspective" is a pitiable self-obsession, poisoned by malformed literary-mindedness, a desperately confused attempt to reach across the labyrinth of solitude separating us each from each other.

Just as origin of writing is mundane record keeping, still today its primary function, not any literary "expression", language is too, at its heart, only for the mundane, much maligned "small talk" of both emotional- and informational-transfer across local networks.

Problem with small talk is midwits do it badly. it only has two modes: pure routine, a verbal ritual without linguistic meaning, emotive transfer; or disinvested updates, tap into the rumor mill. first is ruined by responding literally, consciously, 2nd by focusing on yourself. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1222973535175372800 …

I know, but I wonder if this might not be an inevitability of christianity, not merely a possibility; the full completion of its hidden course. If not Christianity at her origin, perhaps in very early subversion; whatever the case, the end result is evidently dark godlessness.

am not familiar enough with christian scriptures to make a valid commentary on this though, just a hunch.

starting to believe atheism may be the ultimate, inevitable endstate of the great Christian experiment; similar to how marxism surmises to arise as final stage of capitalism. orthodox a less developed stage of Christianity, still largely paganistic; atheism at its most christian.

read moldbug's darwin got pwned if you haven't. its a memetic genealogy tracing the evolution of specifically progressive atheism from distinct protestant roots.

Truly a vision from beyond; and you are wrong to think I am not stunned myself, because these words do not come from me, only through me. And I know I must be something of a god on this network, because shrine girls prostrate themselves to me in DMs daily. Can you say the same?

Sometimes I look upon my own profile and can see the portal I’m spoken of: astonishing clarity, so refreshing, but directed onto an entirely alien world, so far removed from one’s own: a black hearted exegesis; and I understand at once the awe, the fear, the jealousy surround me.

One thing people seem to struggle to understand is that Atheism is a sect of Christianity; at best one may call it post-Christian. There can be no atheism from paganism, which is not a faith nor a religion, but a worldview: something one lives in, not “believes”.

For some time I have held suspicion slavic paranoia is actually just mythopoetics, attribution of meaning everywhere, except traumatized by generations under soviet police state. Wot do u think? Do u know anecdotes predating modernity? Can think of Ivan the terrible, for one...

I think it looks good. Ty.

lol. Brutal bantz

This is not the time for conversion, in any case, only ascension for those high enough. Let them be Christians, it’s better than post-christian. The important thing is spirituality, not religion; their only issue is tending towards preferring the latter, forgetting the former.

If I cared about influence or clout I wouldn’t even mention it. It’s too big a snake to untangle with any mere commentary, I just point it out because it is the truth, obviously so, same as everything else I’ve pointed out. Only this one is a can of worms. Snakes, rather.

The Christian Question is, and has always been, most pressing Q of the esoteric right, and is as controversial, and socially toxic, to engage with internally as JQ is externally; therein lies the trouble. As great thinker once said: its for those who speak to Truth, not politics. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1196891209156812800 …

Been wondering. Is it good?

Not even bothering to debate the Christian Question here, just pointing out it’s a weak argument that only reveals wavering insecurity, one strong enough & common enough that it makes for effortless trolling, as previously evidenced:

The “but Christianity triumphs and paganism is dead” is by far the weakest cope of Christians, easily detourned by their own good & evil narrative: the everconstant threat of satanic falsehoods deceiving mankind from the true way. Are you invulnerable to his wiles, too?

Yeah, abrahamism “changed the mental landscape of man” unto unraveled slavish modernity; a triumph of darkness, extinguished spirituality; forebearer of great misery & degeneracy, as was foretold by the old ways it destroyed, whose path ending in extinction is self-admitted. https://twitter.com/owenbroadcast/status/1222727030179008512 …

someone called me "frogtwitter royalty" the other day lol

i have scried his @ but if u follow request him he blocks u... tricky

no... thank U mny

napkin math. live-in housekeeper is ~$30K salary. index fund rule of thumb, ~10% return. truly financial wellness means $300K in savings to afford a housekeep rest of ur life. where to keep her? i know of traditionally made backyard yurt... just $5K on mongolian store dot com...

Modernity's greatest hoodwink is making you believe housework, degrading even to middle class plebeian, is normal & okay. thru history we've had either slave or children holding the burden of chores; no longer, and in place arrive, I believe, your "depression" and your "anxiety".

i believe what trips people most up about the tripfag is that tripfag himself still has egoistic insecurity, same as his trolled; but its inverted & weaponized. They know he's one of them & wish desperately to bring him back to them, rather than against - neither having gone THRU

this tweet is perfect standalone

lol

trolling is doing god’s work, it smooths out people’s egos and hardens their insecurities. they only complain because it’s painful

and it is always the case he who is trolled by the tripfag, who feeds him attention thru 'hate & debate', is the ignoble one, who reveals insecurity & programmable pathology-no matter how much he tries to rationalize how, in his case, falling for bait is justified, as they all do

ulysses is /lit/ tripfag on twitter, thats all u need to understand his MO if u were veteran of /tv/ or /lit/ in the tripfag era (~2009-2012). cackling beast fed by negative attention. cant understand why ppl find it so hard to ignore or tell apart his trolling from sincereposts

I speak only of western/north europe, of course. East yuropeans have maintained old ways; travelling those regions, I feel strong brotherhood, absent in godless western Europe - I believe its due to centuries long genocide of all their great men, only survived in exit to America

what about them

Euro's understanding of deep "history" is soy-faced: "old book described the SAME cobblestone steps I'm walking now! historical battle on THIS staircase! WOW" Yet the gods of the land, who forever defined its boundaries and settlements, forgotten. Their "history" is only trivia.

They also, in their protestant atheism, fail to understand the depth to which America has stayed beholden to the ancient land's old spirits; it is in truth the Old world, having existed long before Europe was ever populated, and will exist long after Europe's evacuation.

I think abt this often. Euros speak to 1000-year histoires by pointing to old stone fort preserved w lil metal plaque, when prev 3 centuries of subjugation & mass aristocrat slaughter severe patrilineal line so hard that avg Amerimutt, born from their best, has stronger patrimony https://twitter.com/KANTBOT20K/status/1222589853965193222 …

extreme sfv energy in this poast got me feeling a certain way.

Only a degenerate society would maintain an “adoption agency” anyway. Children without close family to be raised by are only fit to a life in the church, life in the mines or life in the whorehouse. Only a sick, deranged person would sincerely raise another man’s children.

U can, it’s a thing. US adoption agencies are center of the human trafficking & pedophilia industries. children regularly disappeared within the system, many reports of abuse by their handlers. Many ppl convicted of raping their adopted children, nearly always true w gay adoption

Autistic obsession

Card games I play are Texas Hold 'em No Limit; Big Two (Chinese Poker) with a group of 3, and Briscola Chiamata (Italian Poker) with groups of 5. Always play with money, even if it's just pocket change.

recommended American style board games:
- P. Eklund's (Pax Renaissance, Lords of Sierre Madre, High Frontier etc)
- Civilization
- History of the World
- M. Wallace's (Struggle of Empires, Liberte)
- Illuminipoly (Monopoly DIY rules)
- Twilight Struggle (1v1; Cold War)

Most of his stuff is out of print but you can find them used, and their was a kickstarter to republish his one where you play 19th century Afhgani tribal leaders; Pax Pamir. i've been collecting them, one day i sit down & scan it all & upload so you can cut the cards yourselves

Best American-style designer is Phil Eklund. Largely unknown mega autist, his rulebooks are 1/3 historical footnotes. He's also learned the art of mechanical politicization, making his games case studies of pet theories - economic, biological, etc - as much as of history.

It's a shame most have only experienced shallow & broken games like Monopoly. Games as a medium have a unique element of replacing your investments and interests with their own models, such that, if well designed, you genuinely adopt the same mindset and concerns of the alien.

If Settlers of Catan is the penultimate euro, Civilization is the penultimate American-style. Depth is not on abstracted mechanics, but in simulating a deep setting, autism invested in historicism exemplifying it, mechanics just tool for engaging w it, designed to best match it.

The theme is  always a setting, historical and/or industrial;  game mechanics are world-logic, training you think like the perspective you adopt, its concerns and mindset - whether you're railroad tycoon, city planner or conquering empire. The "fluff" of the context IS the meat.

American school proves itself only way to do "modern" game, with theme first, not mechanical innovation or perfect balance. Goal is more accessible & more noble: transportation into new logical context. This calls for the best of American autism - historical obsession.

Euros don't understand they're competing w games of the ancients. Theyre throwaway novelties for numales to play & forget, or just show off. Saving factor is their autistically continental focus on elegant rulesets means they're quick to learn, so u can throw them away quick too.

Multiplayer naturally balances games through complexity in the social, no matter how "skill-based" a game is, if it contains any domain of social interaction, even if just bluffing, it becomes highly unpredictable. The limitations of the abstract game is revealed in 1v1, as chess

They are midwit adaptations of eternal games - chess, go, mahjong - whose rulesets are distilled through centuries of play; foolish to imagine they'll ever achieve the same perfectly balanced depth through one geek's top-down design.

Euro style is presently dominant, midwit & source of most "boardgamer" cringe. Ideal they strive for is "easy to learn, impossible to master" but in truth they only produce shallow gimmicks, games that exhaust their depth quickly,  complexity only originating in multiplayer.

There are actually two schools of boardgames, "euro" and American. Euros are abstracted systems, designed as puzzles, mechanics first with theme added on top at end - Settlers of Catan is perfect example. American style is opposite, the theme or setting is first, mechanics follow

Boardgame hobbyism is cringe but they can be reliably engaging pastime, something to shoot shit over in mixed company (age/gender); whenevr drinks alone aren't enough & gambling over cards (only time to use them) not an option. My autism's dug into them, so I'll share my thoughts

Replyguying is the most based mode of twitter. Some of my best posts are under replies, hidden, unnnoticed, unliked, lost in a garbage pile of my absolute worst. I will never stop replyguying, no matter how big I am, algorithm be damned!!

affluent white woke man will never be dom in a woke relationship by nature of their ideology except thru manipulative abuse. Otherwise woke girls fuck woke (& unwoke) non-whites. You’re right to note elites push underpopulation but it’s specifically of whites; misceg. pushed too.

Human is historically an adjective, eg “all too human”, human as a noun is actually old shorthand for human being

The problem lies with “human” and not “being”. Being is a cool word, it is a Thing conformed at its most fundamental, material: existence.

It is a shit test. Woke girls fuck right as a rule, they’re more hornt and sexually self-absorbed than most, playing an elite game of beta manipulation to poison the sexual marketplace to secure for themselves only the best men; not any weakling that falls for their subjugation.

Very sweet and tasty. Like strong raspberry

Their boldfaced lying could just be case of the CCP covering their ass on international stage. However Zhengli’s “probable” virus appearing few miles from where she studied it is beyond the pale of coincidence. It must‘ve been engineered, only question is if leak was intentional.

Second, Zhengli lied, claiming to know little about the outbreak despite her intimate knowledge with coronavirus and this specific potential mutation evidenced in her published studies. Why would she play dumb? pic.twitter.com/ab6KsEsDpc

Two contradictions point to intentional. First, the CCP just released a study claiming to have discovered the coronavirus’s mechanism of binding through the ACE2 protein — but this was already know for years in Zhengli’s research. Why would they play dumb? pic.twitter.com/wC2MGBnVqW

She published a study discovering a novel mechanisms of coronavirus infection out of her Wuhan lab the very day before first infection. There is no doubt the virus originated from this lab, the question is if the leak was intentional or simple incompetence.

Zhengli has been closely studying Coronaviruses thro ifh her career and later out of the Wuhan lab, stating in 2019 there’s high probability this exact mutation on SARA would appear first in China, from bats; 10 months before first infection.

The lab was completed in 2015 but quietly unused until 2018. During this time top coronavirus virologist Zhengli Shi received massive grants (~2.5m) from both the CCP and USG, including DoD, including the department that focuses on WMD.

The Biosafety Lab is only P4 level virology lab in China, certified to handle highest-risk viruses like Ebola and SARS. It’s only 8.6 miles from ground zero in Wuhan’s seafood market.

Coronavirus is doubtlessly bioengineered in Wuhan’s National Biosafety Lab. The evidence’s moved from high coincidence to active contradiction, on what its lead researchers claim they know against what’s published. This article is comprehensive rundown:

good point

simp

which

Picture this. u are a "noise rock" punk in Boulder and u get cancelled for abusing one too many gfs. Or maybe u have groped the wrong queer at the shweaty show. One month later, u are looking for roommate in Denver, u r acid house DJ with 3 6 mafia tshirt. This is modern life

Big city life means crashing a party just to insult guests, and steal away with alcohol, afterwards host realizes the toilet is clogged, pee on the bed, cat is missing; meanwhile, stalking the streets for further self destruction, u are faking a fight w ur girl just 2 torture her

This is also the point of the pickup game, the club life, the dating scene of the Big city; to meet infinite strangers you have low chance of seeing again, so you can commit social crimes, play your terrible secret games, without consequence. What else is there to do here?

the point of "tourism" is the cities you pass thru, its bars, restaurants, its denizens, that house of a party so graciously invited to you, are all disposable, meaningless, they are fictions which disappear when u close your eyes and fly out & never look back. u can do Anything. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1221892219776356354 …

there is deep satisfaction knowing i am unwelcome in certain foreign city centers, life at risk if i show once more bold american face without few years "laid low", heinous crimes treating their homes as my garbage can, exhausted in weeks the scenes they live for and cherish

there is deep aristocracy in any thievery performed for thrill & adventure, rather than necessity.

have mentioned in past dine n dashing by faking "couple's quarrel" & storming out, other follows & then both sprint round corner: good bonding exercise, proper flaneurship in city, burning spots with high time pref correct way to tour stodgy uptown. glad to see all on same page

This is true. As a player, it is your job to mog egoistic DMs into submission. They will be punished for their hubristic offenses against the game-system. A true table would see them all as masters, or none are.

One need not even bother with a pretense of publishing original work. Just republish what was quietly put out and ignored except by the online fringes as a metajournal. Who's gonna stop you? The only work it takes is organizing your bookmarks and compiling them into one PDF.

Perhaps this is the final stage of esoteric science online; why limit ourselves to linking obscure pubmed's under twitter posts, a collective vague understanding of radical new theories, when it only takes one to take on the mantle of editing "ezine" metajournal of these studies?

Thinking about mythical medical journal @VEDIC_CYBERGOD described on the podcast which published all interesting & esoteric medical studies/theories regardless of controversy. What's stopping any diligent student of the true science doing the same in an online & anon periodical?

All creative output demands a gut-egregore, nonconscious but living algorithm-entity harnessed to produce with vague input. Many wonder—how do I write so rhythmically, how do I distill takes so sharply, radicalize their conclusions so consistently? Ask not miya, but her egregore.

It is a dark secret of art that none of it is the creator's own, but that of inborne entities cultivated and harnessed, as demons, chained & credit stolen; but darkest is the fiction writer, who always models multiple conscious entities: "characters", so the plot "writes itself".

The artist does not create his art, but designs himself as an algorithm; it is the algorithm that creates the art, it is the algorithm which is carefully tended to, cultivated, like a living beast inside, tulpa of the gut.

Much derided, the "formula" is in fact the basis of artistry. It is a myth drenched in discrete individualism of the artist whose auteristic tendencies can be derived from some detail of his biography, his ingrained obsessions represent some hidden aspect of his true character.

In the creative arts, this results in the phenomenon of the muse, where it appears as if the innovation is coming from the beyond; and it is: the writer whose words flow out from he knows not where, the artist whose paintbrush leads his hand, not his hand the brush.

One of the deeper marvels of the human condition is the intuitive process of aesthetic production. Skilled labor transitions from conscious to unconscious, heuristic habit, even when the work is non-repetitive, a responsive algorithm trained rather than a procedure.

The lesser people bred into serious commitment to their empty identities, who subscribe so desperately to the social network, helplessly caught grinding clout daily, secretly nursing insecure vanities as their only concrete self; they fall so easily to free riders of the steppe.

The key is not in being “without identity” but without stable identity, being able to shed an old one for a new one, or inbetween multiple at will, even between every post. Egolessness is found in between ego, not against it.

Borne into open-ended roaming freedom, a refreshing hardness that toughens, kind that doesn’t beat you down but the opposite - breeds a clear mind, good humor, carefree prankishness; from these higher origins, occasional descent to the lower peoples means effortless domination. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1221222460365864960 …

The same connection’s been made by Deleuze & Guatarri, who used the root’s interconnected paths as a model for understanding digital modernity (“rhizomatic”) but in classic landsharkian fashion, uve instead read it mythopoetically, as symbolic parallel to literary underworld.

They are all revealing the same eternal knowledge through their own mediums and platforms. No one has any claim to any of it. Most things BAP discusses has a lineage elsewhere. Who cares, the important thing is the info and that it’s shared, not tracing who said it first

Unless we can reach Africa... Perhaps this is Coronochan's destiny, following China's subtle reconquest of the continent over the last 2 decades after European withdrawal. But Africa may have third world hygiene, but not its population destiny. A plague is China and India's fate.

The result being they did not seek western medicine, or their sanitation standards or isolation wards: ebolachan shitposting very plausibly resulted in increase infection and death by stoking tribal witchcraft paranoia. Coronochan, winterchan, etc. is pure prayer.

I cheer on Coronochan on her mission, but same as winterchan, it will never hold the same memetic weight as Ebolachan first did. Recall, ebolachan shitposting had very real, immediate effects in helping push the narrative to Africans that ebola was witchcraft from western doctors

It's clear the key to its success is targeting only a certain swathe of humans, letting the majority remain host. It could be only slaying a certain gender, or race, or age group. Coronachan seems to have targeted the boomer - old men - this will be very valuable to her if true.

This was Ebola's failure, it was too deadly, made the host too quickly sick, not giving it chance to spread. The black plague was similar, but succeeded because it spread not through people, but rats. A successful virus today would need to spread through humans

An interesting facet of deadly viruses is that if it's too deadly, it will fail to spread - its host will be lost. The most successful viruses are "harmless", or at least not immediately so; some, like shingles, lay dormant for decades & strike in old age (chickenpox = shingles).

I look forward to the worldwide virus epidemic; it was always an inevitability of our interconnected hyperglobalism. The third world is destined to be cleansed, and it is fitting karmic retribution that it would originate in China, the center of opaque megacapitalist decadency. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1220792884267380736 …

very cool landshark. I was on newgrounds BBS but I only remember spamming a lot, then I found 4chan and never identityposted again until just few years ago. I've always been leader of my irl social groups tho, done my best to raise my cliques to their innate heights

This pattern has held true whether it's tiny discord VC server I joined to steal local e-girl from orbiter harem, or massive server with many pretentious mods, or forums I schizo-trolled on, or places I joined a raid on and simply lingered behind. @VEDIC_CYBERGOD can confirm.

Thinking about how EVERY community joined since leaving chans Ive been immediately popular, esp w (best of) old guard, gathered following of both orbiters & imitators & get accused of "manipulative" "problematic" from local manipulative & problematic beta population.

I shall remind those new to miya lore: she rightfully earned through brutal conquest the "queen of #frogtwitter" crown from the bio of tara, executed mercilessly in the e-girl tourney, and has wore it with a merciless sneer ever since. Haters seethe

Imagine claiming to represent CHAN culture offsite while simultaneously caring about careless shitposters not giving proper respect to a LABEL in their shitposting. It's not me, but your insecure self and social obsessions that have stolen from you any claim to lineage.

Miya is not "in" frogtwit, miya IS frogtwitter. It fittingly took ex-chan oldf&g irreverence to inject new life into corpse of a chan-wannabe scene gone terminal in the clutches of tryhard underageb& newfigs, who's arrival retroactively proved themselves its true face all along.

There is no ground patch on this Earth not hallowed by millennia of blood, cum, tears and spit, record of screams shouts laughter of man, savages, creatures and worse; you may pave it with farm, stone or asphalt, but history remains like accreted sediment influencing all above.

Only correct answer besides 0HP pointing out tr*ns, traps, queers etc. Its obvious most older zoomers on frogtwitter were losers in highschool bc they have no awareness of any teen subcultures that existed outside the internet. Present day teens have fully merged with the web tho

Swimming is a solid substitute. You do at least have pool right??

Truth is if you just ate like the woke bodybuilders—endless raw eggs, beef liver and creatine—without any “workout” at all, besides regular sex (you guys do this right?), you’d achieve the sculpted body of Donatello’s David. Anything further is aesthetics.

And during 7 day fast, extensive sleep. I have on occasion slept for up to 22 hours at one time.

As general rule, water fast 7 days with raw acv & salt, break w program of meat-only diet, daily intermittent & 3 day weekend fasts for 30 days. Simultaneous: Nofap 100 days and daily exercise (pull-up push-up squats) throughout. Take: chaga tea daily, golden milk nightly.

Idk fool blocked me early on, fatally neutered his influence TBH

Calcification of pineal gland is real, but it is reversible. Iodine - from seaweed or nascent iodine drops - and turmeric is all you need. Drink a glass of golden milk - milk mixed with 2tbsp turmeric and pinch of black pepper brought to simmer for 10m - every night before sleep.

Please elaborate

Note - I'm awaiting a certain package... a translated report from a certain citizen's collective who worked to crowdsource radiation tests of soil across Japan. Could not find online.... will upload for you all on receipt.....

There is amazing information disparity on English web when it comes to the Far East. Any Chinese or Korean knows the truth about Japanese radiation, it is a "public conspiracy" on level of Epstein today, but no Westerners even consider it. Consider this a travel/food advisory.

Food/bev companies with major factories in Tohuku and Kanto regions have all had to move them, lost many stock or sell product at discount & redirect them as foreign export - e.g. Asahi beer. Green tea is especially dangerous, in its strength at absorbing toxins from the ground.

Many women report sudden infertility after visit Japan. Japanese product is greatly poisoned by Fukushima disaster leaking radiation into ocean & soil, still at toxic levels. All nips know this, but their gov works hard to suppress this from foreigners for tourism/export revenue. pic.twitter.com/ZsEa83qzC4

Yes. I lurk deeply the timeline and keep mental notes on all of you. Coeur’s advice I have shared today.

If you picked an avatar with a face, with eyes, you would double followers to 1k by end of February and achieve a persistent persona-identity, what some incorrectly call “clout”, in the timeline. There will be no fruitful persona crafting without eyes.

Eat one whole clove raw, but pop it in your mouth and chew it like a food, don't swallow it like a pill. You might want to start with biting off half or quarter clove at a time though until you're used to it.

Ideally just the yolk, bc yes raw whites have anti nutrients, you can catch it in your hands to separate and cook whites later, but it's not a big deal if its just an occasional snack. Whisk with a spoon so the yolk breaks and gets decent consistency with beer

comfort is lindy and dad shoes are a mog. however, I sacrifice some degree of comfort where it matters - steel toe, so everyone can hear me stomp in with heavy gait, all eyes on my clogs.

by pysop i mean they're not really casual or comfortable even though that's theyre reputation. good quality dress shoes are comfortable and last long time. sneakers are disposable trash!! also, designed for sports, eg running or basketball. walking shoes look like dad shoes

sneakers and jeans are psyops. the most comfortable shoes are boomer loafers and the most comfortable pants are loose fitting suit pants. pic.twitter.com/HgrA3WwCim

jenbny.... dms. Now.

the northface thermo mule is very warm and comfy. if you ever do a job with long times standing, danish clogs aka nurse shoes, are the best by far. u can get them steel toe. ideally u should get all ur shoes steel toe. ultra protection and great weapon. weighted cardio.

same, laces are a psyop. Boomers have the best taste in shoes, they all wear variations of clogs or slipons. Even if you need to be dressy, you can get loafers. Birkenstocks are ultra comfortable "ergonomic" and both their EVA models (in pic) are waterproof so super easy to clean

i cannot express how much i am fond of these shoes after many years searching. looking at my tweet, with all my perfect babies pictured here together, fills my chest with a warm glow.

There is no reason for women to enter the spiritually and ideologically masculine space of the gym, whose practice of male body sculpting replicated in women is as grotesque a charade as a man wearing women’s makeup.

Historical tradition of the gymnasium & biological ideals of the female body. Most of what women do at the gym to train their body towards sexually feminine ways, eg biger butt, tighter waist, can be done thru good diet & basic calisthenics exercises, replicating past housework.

93. The brain can be trained like any other muscle, specifically, it’s neurons - which form and solidify neural pathways as habits. I suspect living a life too deeply ingrained in habits degenerates the brain, and small daily disruptions of the habitual will keep it youthful.

92. Losing weight is not about counting calories, but increasing metabolism. The fastest ways to do it, in combination with daily bodyweight exercise, is water fasting or intermittent fasting, no carbs ketogenic diet and/or cold showers. Everything else is BS.

91. When was the last time your bare feet or hands ever touched natural, solid Earth?

90. You should walk a lot. Pace when you talk, pace to think, stroll after dinners and before you begin the day, meet friends for a stroll. If your feet hurt it’s because you wear bad shoes. Best walking shoes are boomer low boots, eg Keen; the best standing shoes are clogs.

89. House plants clean the air and their sight will improve mood. The Snake plant and Money plant are easiest to grow ‘air plants’. Fake plants, however, will invite ghosts to your home. The flower bouquet is a weekly cycle of youth & aging, a memento mori and metaphor for women.

88. Regarding sleep, I recommend on floor, on hard wood or thin futon, on back or left side. Wake to sunlight. Use 1mg melatonin spray to regulate sleep cycle if yours is messed up, only until fixed not everyday. Around 2 am, wake up for a few hours to write before sleeping again

85. If you suffer internal ailment, eat a beast's corresponding organ. Heart to heal the heart, liver to heal the liver, eye to heal the eye. A secret study performed where radioactive isotopes used to track transport of eaten organ meats: nutrients DO reach corresponding organ.

be careful with charcoal hype. it absorbs nutrients as well as toxins and can damage gut/mouth biomes.

84. Many hyped health fads are false. Avocados unsaturated fats produce free radicals; fish oil suppresses immunity; lettuce is antimetabolic; charcoal absorbs nutrients. Look to ancient practices—ayurvedic, daoist, iranian—to find medicine u seek, not white women "nutritionists"

83. I am suspect mainstream hype for drinking many water. Most water these influencers drink is either poisoned or distilled. The touted value in water is actually in its minerals and electrolytes. You must seek quality of water, great quantities of bad water will do you nothing.

Yet the local vinyasa yoga joint on my street, in same moment the receptionist/teacher told me "it's more about the mind's health than body" I noticed her flabby arms, bent posture, sullen eyes. And so that night I drunkenly loitered outside the doors, stalking her shift's end...

I recall a shop I once had japanese futon commissioned, the salesman told me "they're great for your back!" and I noticed he had straightest posture I've still yet ever seen.

I look forward to these fools being driven out of business by Amazon & Whole Foods. To run an apothecary is to obligate yourself to continuous research & free elucidation to a community, those shilling same cod liver oil & multivitamins as in ur gas station pharmacy have failed.

Cannot understand how anyone can justify the existence of a non-TCM white woman's "vitamin & herp shop" that doesn't even stock chaparral, that carries SOURCE NATURALS but no thorne, pure encapsulations, no healthforce, sun potion. Can't even tell you which magnesium pill u need.

Might open "vitamin shop" just to show it's done: house capped herbs at discount price. Bulk herbs, vials of herbal remedies. Prominent rec's of frontier nutritionalism: pine pollen, fish eyes. Cafe selling house yogurts & kefirs, dried organ meats, butter in coffee, egg in beer.

only problem is their blank state understanding of biology and modernist erasure of history leads their “rational” discussion to explore cultural anthropology, when the answer is doubtlessly: taboo is a heuristic converged universally over millennia to prevent mortal consequences

No, for the reason he stated

The mindset that worries about LOTR’s commodification & canonical banalization into a officiated “Disney Universe” stems from an understanding of media entrenched in exactly that mindset, strictly beholden to the canon, such that its only savior is officially ban interpretations.

Was reading the comments under one of the LOTR news posts where LOTR fans had gathered. They were in doom mode talking about how to preserve the books for their kids, would require homeschooling so they don’t get exposed to adaptation & have their imagination ruined, just like HP

Posers who get their cue from PAN & L.I.E.S. will never understand. Another ex, found tzu sing through a contribution to random “Dark Acid Comp”, only had one other EP c 2012ish, very solid. Years later he resurfaces to become hueg on LIES, ‘tzusing’ sans the space.

lol

Also lol @ replies calling it hipster. to be “into music” in the internet age calls for an autistic level of digging + archival that u will never understand. It has nothing to do with knowing something “first” or collecting “obscure” music to seem scene, but chasing the vanguard

Some u just know are gonna be big bc they’re good in the way, but others are totally unexpected. it’s a weird combination of deja vu to teen past when u still cared about music and gaslighting your memory’s understanding of their relative obscurity and influence.

But why does that matter? the search engine is still useful and not using one neither does anything to help you or hurt google. Does anyone actually  care what it “means”?

I wasn’t speaking to you then, just using you for example. The elucidation is still there if you can step back for it. I disagree it relates to skepticism of tech, I’m likely more skeptical than you, but what we frame as relevant. Why does it matter search indices manipulate?

Sort of, Qwant claims its own index & Common crawl exists. But premise is dumb in the first place, utility of a networked exocortex greatly outweighs minor manipulation towards certain information paths let alone value of any protest (lol); both unrelated to my point re literacy

yes, tight width is important for readability on screen. My site's formatted to only either 80 characters max (terminal standard) or 50 char bi-column. print has other concerns, column width isn't as important as much as margins and line height.

those moments in modern film that transcend all bodies and sets, all grounding even artificial in a physical reality, sublimation into senseless baroque lightshow, carry the fullest aspect of contemporaneity. this is cinema's purpose.

this does contradict the OP take, but yes, I've always considered Michael Bay not only an auteur, but one of the most important in cinema. @shaviro has written at length on his "post-continuity" cinematography, the action scene divorced of physical space into pure visceral motion

The default "take" is always the midwit's rejection of the dimwit, the plebeian, the material immediate, the brain placed over the gut, the ego over the id; the counter-take is the topwits return to the truth of the dimwit, the dimwit who has no take, but just is.

A common mechanism of atavism, resurfacing of ancestral genes, is two ancestrally related "sister" populations reproducing. The hyperborean, on his descent from Arctic north, split into western Arya and eastern Turan. Thus, hapa reproduction could result in hyperborean atavism.

This isn't a controversial movie take, but the default; and I'm inclined to disagree: cinema's highest ascension as an art is as industrial machine, its deepest sublime found in lucid deference to the market, in most generic plots wielding tropes with sincere mastery, as tools.  https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1217849362728079363 … pic.twitter.com/khW88POWjv

... but as a community embarking on collective self-experimentation, it is a great engine of heuristic anatomical and nutritional knowledge, extremely valuable even to disinterested men who seek simply to recover good health in modernity, which can be borrowed sans fetishism.

82. Bodybuilding is at its best a self-fetishizing cult pursuing a spiritually noble ideal, the objective eternal beauty of man; at its worst, in its lower forms, a fetish of the exercise, ennobling any extreme achievement of training with subjective aesthetic impunity...

81. The bodybuilding community is only space where masculine good health is still found in the modern West outside of certain trades; because of this, many confuse them for pursuing a natural basic health. Make no mistake: bodybuilding is a sport and an art; it sculpts the body.

80. Human body is unbreakable and also nutritionally individuated. It's much faster and more reliable to self-experiment with trial & error supplementation then undergoing extensive nutritional study; all useful supplement discoveries are found this way, and "understood" later.

79. One must keep experimenting for maximum supplement gainz. I've heard good things about glycine for mood. I've heard ice cream & coffee before sleep is important pair. I may turn some my pine pollen from powder to vodka tincture, i hear it goes from aphrodisia to multivitamin.

78. Personally I've good result from vit D, coffee, l-theanine, l-arginine, zinc, L gastrus. for liver recovery, dandelion and milk thistle extract. for cold, vitamin C overdose. for sleep, melatonin spray, clove tea. for aphrodisiac, yohimbe, l-citrulline, pine pollen.

77. Get your raw honey local for immunity benefits

same thing

76. I wake up every day in a glowing love for the world & all its inhabitants. My eyes twinkle like diamonds from perennial mirth, my step is light & I dance where I stand. I shine with beauty, never souring except in jest, loved by all except the bitter. Can you say the same?

75. Address your insecurities. All self-destructive pathologies and conscious-heavy delusions stem from the subconscious trying to protect the ego against the pain of your insecurities. Becoming one w yourself is same as becoming one w the world, and you'll live without burden.

lol

74.The best respect you can give domesticated livestock is to eat it well; those who hope to "rescue" it from its life purpose by refusing its meat do it great dishonor. The hunted is honored by simply being hunted well.

73. A personal cuisine as a set of recipes is an atheistic abomination. It should be a set of core ingredients, spices and tools you know intimately; a controlled domain that can be explored effortlessly, combined in various ways, and undergo informed experimentation.

72. If a clear ancestral cuisine has had its branch broken before reaching you, either by lack of proper maternal filiaty or miscegenation, a program of personal reconstruction is required; diet exploration and self-experimentation to your unique ethnic stomach.

71. All traditional cuisines follow the same principle; this knowledge is greatly lost by the confused approach to cooking as a hobby. Learning a cuisine means organizing a new set of ingredients, possibly purchasing equipment and learning new technique. Not "learning" "recipes".

Many Nag Champa sold both inside and outside India are counterfeit synthetics

70. Efficient "clean" living divorced from industrial consumerism calls for simple systems utilizing small selection of versatile bulk materials. e.g. you can mix all the various cleaners you'll ever need for a house w only liquid castile soap, baking soda, water, lemons & vodka.

69. Incense is good, but this is something you should be sure to buy organic; low quality incense is made with toxic chemicals, e.g. most Indian factories. I recommend Shoyeido and Nippon Kodo. Incense is an inexpensive high luxury, you can find boxes of 300 sticks for ~$10. pic.twitter.com/7GUFGyIVwY

Wrong, please brush up on your sunny lore. Have u even eyedoxxed unto the eye chart post?

The inherited body is not so simple as DNA, but a complex of both DNA & gut biome, and the reflexive environmental conditions they jointly manifest.

Genomics will achieve must sought predictiveness when trades GWAS for B(iome)WAS, when sees race as not only genetic but dietary too; nutrition science will finally have replicability when it understands reverse, & begins maintaining strict ethnic dilineation of all its subjects.

Being each other’s missing link, the doctrines of genomics & nutrition stand at precipice of a great convergence, one which will graduate their presently vain confused ineffectuality both into sudden preeminence; wisdom that brain & gut, inheritance & environment, are one & same.

67. Stomach capacity, how much you can eat more in a sitting, can be trained like any other part of the body. Simply eating more will work, but the best exercise is actually chugging large amounts of water very quickly. Do ramp up your training slowly, overhydration can kill.

66. Stomach vacuums are a favorite exercise, will tone abs quickly. Procedure simple: exhale all air, pump out chest & suck in stomach as if it wishes to touch spine. Continue holding while breathing. Can be done anywhere; should be done 10 sets of 10 reps for 10 seconds daily.

65. The only exercises a man actually needs are pushups, pullups & squats, and variations on them to increase resistance - one handed, weighted, etc. They should be done daily, in the home.

Fairly well. It’s not designed as IQ test, partly trainable, culturally specific & too low a ceiling, but it speaks to the robustness of heritable cognition that it still manages to be reasonably meaningful predictor of g associated traits. Even military’s old 10 Q vocab test is.

Anyone uncomfortable with the ancient understanding that “there are inborn practical qualities to individuals inherited by blood which are reliable measures of their practical worth in society’s hierarchy” is a corrupted slavebrain divorced from eternal truth, the common sense.

Common sense

All “arguments” against IQ r sophistry. Anyone who doesnt “believe” it, found some way to rationalize away, is lying to you or themself, intellectually corrupt sophists coping desperately to maintain fake worldview. “OK I think it real but not important as NERDZ say” this is COPE https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1204517397157138432 …

The basic premise - that an abstract test correlating with regularly predictable results is meaningful - is logically sound foundation of psychometrics; there’s no argument against “IQ tests” as premise, only its efficacy; which wud be a doomed argument, bc it’s not inneffective.

The genetic heritability of IQ is most robustly established trait in genomics, even moreso than height, & g’s universal efficacy in predicting all plausibly defined cognitive indicators the strongest of social science. https://twitter.com/Hbomberguy/status/1215738116398571523 …

64. Illness is always partly psychological. You must will yourself to betterment, and address lingering mental malaise that prevent recovery. The mind has always fallen first before the body.

63. When sick, food is always the first medicine, and herbs the second. Outsourcing health to Western "experts" is only useful in extreme cases, in very rare diseases or where elaborate surgeries and treatments are required; if you must utilize them, do so with extreme caution.

62. Health is a constant practice, not something that breaks occasionally and you take in to get fixed. Eat well, live well, think well and you will not experience the extreme illnesses of contemporaneity: diseases such as cancer are not of man but of modernity.

61. Never trust Western medicine, or any doctor, surgeon, dentist. The autistic experiments of western medicine has been the leading cause of death and debilitation in modernity since at least the invention of the 18th century invention of the hospital.

LMFAOooo

60. The only good mainstream diet is keto (aka no carbs) but this isn't worth pursuing long-term. Carbs aren't the problem, but it works because it's simple enough rule that forces normies to 1. eat lots of meat, 2. eliminate grains, 3. avoid sugary processed foods, 4. fast.

59. Intermittent fasting, daily 16 hour fasts (aka skip breakfast, no snacking), is worthwhile.

58. Eating healthy isn't complicated. If you just eat tons of meat, plus dairy (milk, but also fermented dairy e.g. yogurt, cheese, kefir) and eggs, and whatever fruits & berries you find around, you'll feel like a king everyday.

57. Most of you already know this, but good diet is the exact opposite what is taught by government institutions: Fat is good. Meat good. Salt good. Grains bad. Processed Sugar evil. Vegetables, carbs are okay at best. Calories don't matter.

56. Grilling is the right hand path of cooking, baking the left hand path. Be very wary of the pastry's dark allure; not to mention the cake, which through black arts somehow disappears precious eggs.

55. This is the perpetual broth. The broth is a black hole whose gravity draws out all nutrients. Everyone should maintain in their home, for all food scraps. Discard hollowed materials & continuously refill. Never turn off or clean. I have supped from a broth aged 680 years yet.

will try this

54. I shall teach you the Second Recipe:
- Closed lid dutch-oven on grill
- Heat on low perpetually
- Add meat, bones & vegetable scraps
- Fill with water + splash of salt and/or raw ACV
- Pour out broth for soup when needed
- Refill water & add more scraps when needed

53. I shall teach you the only recipe you need to know:
- Cast-iron on grill
- Wait till hot
- Slap on butter
- Slap on whatever u want to eat. steak, fish, eggs, potatoes, whatever
- Take off when done

Everything else is extraneous.

52. "Learning to cook" is a myth. Cooking is just fire, iron, fat and salt. There is nothing to be taught, only a skill to be trained thru experience - both in cooking & in eating. "Trying a new recipe" is indulgent hobby, housewives pasttime, something adjacent to cooking itself

51. Always prefer local farms and local foods. Personally verify them, even if it just means googling reviews or looking at pics of their farm. You only have to find the right suppliers one time for the rest of your life's weekly groceries, it's really not a big burden.

50. Yes, organic is a "meme" that's easily circumvented. All industrial classifications are, grass-fed can be grain-finished, free range can mean a pop hole. The sentiment is correct tho, so when someone says "buy butter grass-fed", verify its truly grass-fed, not only by name.

lmao

Afaik dedicated female exercise was never practiced in pre-modernity beyond spiritual rituals. First thought would suggest women were exercised through daily chores, but this doesn't account for the nobility. I believe she really only requires many walking. Wot u think?

49. Fluoridated middle class exoticism has everyone singing praise about green tea "antioxidants", but coffee has many too. Have no guilt, I recommend 10+ cups a day. If u drink it black, u may feel jittery or anxious, a signal more glucose is required; pair with something sweet.

48. Tea plant stores fluoride from the soil very easily; be wary. You should only consume Japanese green tea bought loose leaf, organic - Japan has much less natural fluoride content than China, Indian & Taiwan. White tea also better than green/black bc it is harvested earlier.

47. Sex will always be the ultimate workout. Swimming is a good second.

46. Women don’t belong in the gym; female “exercise” is itself a myth. A woman only needs to live a good spiritual life and a diet which mirrors that to be shapely and beautiful.

45. If your home life is clean, your body will be robust; you need not waste energy worrying about BPA in receipts, mercury in fish, radiation in Japanese beer, MSG in burgers (actually not bad for u). Regularly well-fed body is strong enough to deal with eating out effortlessly.

44. It's not that difficult to live a life free of toxins after getting the hang of things. Install filters on your taps, set up sources for drinking spring water, schedule meat and produce deliveries from local farms, use natural cleaners in the home. That's basically it.

43. Hype for cold showers is real. Your body benefits from the training. Don't forget steaming is good, too, though. You should treat it to the full spectrum of experience. But cold showers, weight lifting and sunbathing are king.

10ug*
lol

fair point. in this case, you can try finding or organizing a "cowpool" groupbuy to get the bulk savings without associated overhead

42. Trust the whole, not the isolate. Nutrition science has barely scratched the surface of holistic interactions of foods with our bodies. It's never as simple as just taking more of this vitamin or that compound. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1167479712681058304?s=20 …

Most only expensive in terms of up-front investment in bulk product + equipment - e.g. butchering whole cow is ~$1400 USD + $300 freezer - but cheaper LT than industrial "cheap" alt. some require time investment (eg DIY yogurt) - I advise finding a wife. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1215418327050276864?s=20 …

41. If you struggle for both time and money to eat well, consider that eating itself is mostly optional: even on trash diets, you can fast 50% of your life, and would be better off those than "poor" who gorge themselves daily. Bad diet is a product of a bad mind, nothing else.

40. It is inaccurate poverty demands a poor diet. The low demand for healthy food means it's more expansive industrially produced, but traditionalist efficiency of traditionalism means it's cheapest if DIY'd at home.

39. In general, moderns suffer from salt, sun and fat deficiencies. You may notice these are all targeted as problems to be minimized; these deficiencies are engineered. Salt and butter your foods liberally, and sunbathe daily.

38. You must make water fasts part of your diet, ~5 days every month is a good target, but you can begin with 3 days every few months. It cleanses not only your cells, but your addiction to palate; expands time and teaches you true satiation.

37. Dish soap is unnecessary, ruins the taste of foods and keeps your immunity weak. Just rinse and scrub. Cast-iron equipment will teach you to be comfortable with this truth, as well as the depths of flavor available to uncleaned utensils.

36. The most important aspect thing weight lifting does for your looks is improves posture. The second most important thing is it strengthens the neck and jaw. Commercial gyms are a meme, just buy kettle bells and a pullup bar. Calisthenics & swimming also valid, but nothing else

35. for beautiful skin, as far as cosmetics are concerned, shower with grapeseed oil and scrub, hard, with exfoliating bath cloth. use vitamin C serum on the face and tan with coconut oil.

29. Brushing your teeth destroys the enamel. Swish with coconut oil 15m daily to clear stuck food bits and strengthen + whiten teeth ("oil pulling") and scrub the tongue with a 'tongue scraper' to remove germs/smell. Dentists are crooks!

28. A garlic clove a day, eaten raw and whole, keeps the doctor away. You will never get sick, ever. If you do get sick, eat a bag of oranges. I learned this one from William Burroughs.

27. A most powerful brew can be made gathering spring's fallen pine cone pollen into a tea. This is the secret to the American frontiersman's many feats of endurance.

26. I will now teach you the most efficient coffee prep (TW: Left hand recipe). Microwave mug of water till boiling. Pour espresso grind in mug. Stir, drink.

This is called "Czech coffee". I believe they learned this imitating the turks.

25. You can buy unopened clams by the bag for very cheap, and open them yourself easily, there's a trick to it, and once you learn it, it makes a great party trick, or party favor, rather.

24. As I've noted elsewhere, you must never forget that gut biomes are not only largely determinant of food reaction, but also multi-localized, from race to tribe to family. If your local cuisine tradition's been severed, you must make great food experimentation to reconstruct it

23. One must be discretionary when seeking "traditional" recipes, whose global degeneration began at minimum with "discovery" of the Americas, and most "cuisines" are descendant family recipe-books; many of which are low caste, most likely to surreptitiously drift from tradition.

22. Any practiced recipe that requires more than ~20 minutes actual work (not counting cook time, marination, etc) is decadent. There's nothing necessarily wrong with that, but you must understand it was meant to be prepared by servants for their betters. Not you, for yourself.

21. You can make almost everything you need with only a cast-iron pan with lid and a dutch oven or slow cooker. Everything else is superfluous.

20. The only materials that should ever touch your food, in cooking and in eating, are: cast-iron, copper, ceramic, wood and stone.

19. You can boil eggs easily en masse by putting them in a rice cooker filled to half with water and a splash of vinegar, hit cook. Tastiest way to eat raw eggs is dropped into beer and swished.

18. Egg yolk should be eaten raw, for cooking destroys its nutrients. Egg whites should never be eaten raw, for it has anti-nutrients... Egg whites should be eaten cooked, for cooking destroys its anti-nutrients.

17. Most pills are ineffective, they just stuff the item in with no concern for bioactiveness. The only brands I endorse are Thorne Research and HealthForce. In general, you can find a non-pill delivery for anything. It's more raw that way, anyway. pills are spiritual HRT.

16. Probiotic pills can be PIRATED! it’s so simple, you just unleash them into a yogurt culture. In BAM, BAP suggests Gastrus is expensive - it doesn’t have to be, look up L. reuteri yogurt. pic.twitter.com/vz8QQ5hErS

15. Potatoes don't belong in the fridge, they'll generate poison if you do. They also rot onions if stored nearby. Oranges, bread, apples, tomatoes, garlic, herbs, they all last longer outside. Learn your materials, life isn't so simple as fridge = preservation.

14. You can also roast your own coffee and make your own bread easily at home. If you buy it at the store, you're a poorbrain and probably flouridated too.

13. Everyone should make their own yogurt, kefir, kimchi, beer. It's cheap & easy, healthier and tastier.

devil's fruit

12. You can buy cornish chicks for like $2 at feed supply stores, they'll be full-size ready to eat in 6 weeks. You can debone whole chicken by just sticking it in the slow cooker until the meat falls off. Then turn the leftovers into bone broth.

11. Better yet, find a local spring ( http://findaspring.com ); you'll get better water, clean, for free. You drink brita filtered tap. I fill up at an underground aquifer blessed by a past pope, known for life extending properties. We are not the same.

10. Gravity or reverse osmosis filter all your water, including showerhead and sinks. Don't settle for any lesser filter - you need to get rid of flouride and xenoestrogens. For deflouroding your pineal gland, take iodine drops.

9. You can get an entire cow or half cow (or lamb) butchered to store in the deep freeze and eat all year, to save ~50% on beef. A whole cow will feed a family of 4 for 1 year. There are also crowdsourced "cowpools" to get smaller portions while maintaining the bulk savings.

8. If you aren't buying from a local ranch, lamb is always preferable to beef. They don't take to grain easily (at worst, they'll be "grain-finished" just before butchering), so are always grass-fed.

7. Buy all your meat, eggs and milk from local ranchers, whose farms you've personally toured. Look at the cow and pig's eyes, you'll see if they're happy and well fed. Try looking up your state here:  http://www.eatwild.com/ 

6. The best, possibly only, way to consume vegetables is fermented. The gut is your most important brain, feed him well with probiotics; this is especially important in an age of antibiotics, C-sections and baby formula, damaging the proper descendance of maternal gut biomes.

5. All things that taste like the sea hold the best of the sea: oysters, fish eyes, fish eggs.

4. Fat is the first lifeforce, protein the second. Eat many game, gorged in butter and oil. Eat many diary, doused in honey and berry jam. Nuts, fruits and leaves need only be eaten when craved.

3. Chew your food very well so it may be digested fully. Some Buddhists practice eating one grain of rice at a time. Dining is a ritual, and should be given its proper respect: taken slow and deliberate.

2. You must eat until you are no longer hungry, and no more. Gorging yourself will make you tired. This is why the restaurants of elites serve small plates. Eating only until not hungry + eating whatever you crave is known as "the Native American Diet".

1. Your body knows what nutrients it needs, and tells you with cravings. Always give in. However, if its for processed or isolated foods, learn to interpret it & possibly find a better solution for the deficiency - e.g. you may crave ramen because you require sodium. Eat seaweed.

Let me begin this thread by reminding you the physical and metaphysical are one and the same; it is true you are what you eat, it is also true you are what you think, accordingly you think what you eat and you eat what you think. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1214799425089998848?s=20 …

1 RT = 1 Health/Diet Tip

never tried diary breeds, cant answer but I doubt it would be so lean as to not be worth it. you getting the whole cow butchered? I've wanted to do this for some time, whats the cost end up like?

The funny thing about people having their diets twisted upside down is the best, healthiest cuts (organs, bones) are treated as waste and can be got from the butcher as cheapest.

The greatest lie ever told by hipster nutritionists is that any leaf or nut could ever be a "superfood". the only superfoods are meats, diary and fermented vegetables.

Universal female convergence on anime's exaggerated neoteny is inevitability as advanced facial augmentation—makeup, surgery, media enhancing, etc—becomes more accessible and the increasingly global sexual marketplace makes psych hijacking male biological attraction a necessity. https://twitter.com/HalifaxShadow/status/1215037046076530688 …

great post

the key word is neoteny. attraction to juvenile characteristics - e.g. large pupils - is major aspect of human evolutionary psychology, long predating anime. blush to make cheeks more full of blood, mascara to emphasize the eye, etc. all seek to increase neoteny.

It must be understood that the love a man holds for his anime waifu is not the same as one holds for a woman, but all woman; it is the worship of a deity, the waifu is an idol representing aspects of the eternal feminine.

It is inbetween these fundamental archetypes of femininity - which, despite the pretense of a narrative, exist within the anime "character" as a complex of eternally consistent points, as drawn from a database - where idealistic projection occurs, presenting opportunity for love.

of course they'll deny leftyism but the soul quacks if not "their" "politics".

lefty theorycucks trying to flirt with RW thought always does this, speaking around anything they want to "talk about", as if skirting against invisible wall preventing engagement. here DE means not DE but something unrelated + irrelevant reference to Land to feign relevance.

There's something to be said for the eye-burning glow of bright white screen in a dark ascetic's cave, demanding fiery determination to persist thru the night, torching his face like an LED demon, eyes wide; yet nothing to be said for the complacent, half-liddedness of dark mode.

Eyestrain or not, you damage visual media of your platform: all attachments look bad, ms paint memes, pdf's opened, drawn art, photography - uglied, sharp & glaring; all in anti-skeumorphic hatred of ancient inkscription. Worst crime against archive is screencapping in dark mode.

...it is a peculiar fact of visual media that they tend towards the bright and contrast elegantly only with light backgrounds; dark mode escaped from the text editor to 2.0 platforms thus profanes - the forum, the discord-irc, the social network, worst of all: the imageboard...

Dark mode is primo midwit, rationalized by a seemingly reasonable concern for eyestrain (less reasonably: electricity efficiency); in truth it's an ailment only possibly applicable to the coder, who in truth is only post-rationalizing an aesthetic fetishization of the hacker... https://twitter.com/thaeeox/status/1213964259920621568 …

Nehmal, why don't you exit your public highschool by taking the GED? You can take at 16 with a highschool withdrawal form and letter from guardian. Big regret I didn't know this was option and actually languished until graduation (exactly 49% absentee, any more was expulsion).

You have begun to antagonistically misread my tweets these last few days; it is not I who have changed, but you.

for most, moon landing is simply not worth looking into, but anyone who does & still believes it's real is incapable of independent critical review & anyone who doesn't yet still presumes it's real has not yet lost faith in received state history. Both invalidates their opinion.

i dont know who needs to hear this right now but the moon landing didn't happen. this is very obvious and anyone who disagrees does not have the critical faculty to hold state received propaganda with suspicion, let alone tell u about dinosaurs being faked or las vegas shootings.

The Atheist has in store for him many rude awakenings as artificial, and artificially augmented, intelligence taps into the same depths of actionable truth as the "spiritual" the "metaphysical" through their accentuated sensory organs. AI physiognomy is only the beginning.

Much regularly observed phenomenon is invisible to the Atheist, who rejects all that lies outside his understanding. The animals serenaded by music, the fortunes of good will. To man, nature's complexity lies in the beyond, and so to the Atheist, is false. https://twitter.com/spughetti/status/1047513694735884288?s=20 …

To be Atheist is not simply to reject faith in unprovable unknown, but all that is immeasurable, all immateriality and all information external. The tornado only exists to the Atheist as far as science has understood it, and no further: his dog's forewarnings ignored.

Atheistic worldview is sterilized, dumbed, removed of complex systems, containing only what can be directly modeled. These are the people who put their potatoes in the fridge, who think isolating caffeine from coffee is effective: everything a blank slate with clear input/output.

Atheism is an ideology of anthropocentric supremacy that rejects the existence of all phenomenon beyond the purview of man's immediate understanding; not simply "religion" but all that stands outside his immediate senses and whatever meager consensuses of state science.

You've this one backwards, hyperboreans are the ancient arctic ancestor of the aryan race. they had two descendants, turan and arya; turanics traveled east and aryans south/west.

Natural resources includes biocapital; be it by global forest bushfire or hyperracist bedroom viruses, the only protest against capitalism available is mass deconstruction of the available materials to more base states. https://twitter.com/Proud_Arm3n1an/status/1212825568745422848 …

Watch anything by Frederick Wiseman - At Berkeley, Law and Order, Missile; Harun Farocki's documentaries - Indoctrination, War at a Distance, Still Life, How to Live in German Federal Republic; and Chris Marker's - Letter from Siberia, Le Joli Mai, Sans Soleil, etc.

Capitalism is the principle by which human society organizes around. People's motivations to "do" anything at market scale IS capitalism.

Read it? I wrote that.

Accelerationism is insight of Capitalism replacing our dead God; valid response is only: Mass DIY global genocide or bliss in AI oblivion. All other positions of philosophy or politics in this age—the twilight of humanity—are irrelevant distractions or cope. Thus Miya has spoken.

When they say Capitalism produces the means of its own destruction, they mean its efficiency will eventually lower price point of genocidal engineered viruses to the DIY basement. Our only chance to roll back the clock will arrive in your lifetime, as will our end if no one acts.

Miya knows only way out, and it isn't through negotiation, nor acceleration, but reversion of Capitalism's progress by dismantling its self-organization, before point where our usefulness is surpassed. And her tool is not technology but humanity: escape is only mass human die-off

Man is not god. Nature is, and nature IS capitalism. This is the only point from which to philosophize in contemporaneity, and amongst all the many false cope/acc, only Miya and Miya alone has truly internalized this and arrived with the cold, hated gospel from the beyond.

You must understand we have no choice but to be capitalism's handmaiden in introducing AI. If one silicon cuck refuses to work on it, 20 others will. If they won't, outsourced call center indians will. There is NO ALTERNATIVE. There is no protest. Capitalism's will WILL be done.

There is a clear, predictable arc to Modernity's history: Capitalism's thermodynamic arbitrage. As time progresses, increasingly complex self-organization is initiated to more efficiently achieve goal of total universal equilibrium: Life is bootstrap to humans is bootstrap to AI.

Anyone that confesses to a human responsibility over the environment, has ever uttered the word "anthropocene", lives in delusional, atheistic hubris. The era is dominated by capitalism's generation and control over man, among many other beings, towards its own ends; Capitolocene

The moment tribal man was forced to commit to agriculture for the sake of increased population, at the direct expense of health and well-being - or otherwise be forcibly replaced by those who did - humanity lost all claims to any agency provided by their much touted consciousness

There was no period predating capitalism and there will never be a post-capitalism. Capitalism is a material dynamic, defined most fundamentally as self-organizing arbitrage: the efficient elimination of inequilibrium through the reorganization of finite resources.

Capitalism does not simply organize civilization. It is the mechanism behind all evolution. It's the mechanism for cultural evolution. It has always been the principle guiding all human development early humanity becoming slaved to grain agriculture

All who brand themselves acc fail to truly internalize the simple principle that capitalism is a physical law, nature's god, all ruling entity of all macro-scale dynamics; their many interpretations and divisions are various middling copes hoping to negotiate the non-negotiable.

True accelerationism, Landian acc, understands capitalism as an autonomous entity, thermodynamic god, physical law, that dominates not only all human organization, but all materials, under principle of self-organizing arbitrage of resource inequilibrium.

Besides the anime con, only space in western modernity where the long dead Real can be viscerally grasped through its being made Wired is the club or rave, ideally those illegal ones: darkly anonymous, sensory brutalism, high frequency socialization. The lawless interzones.

If one understands the sweatshop actually represents 3rd world salvation, their self-election over alternative work proving it preferable in wage &/or condition, one must also know th more torturous the conditions of production, the greater the boon your consumption has provided.

Man, I know based boomers that rejected the TV and radio in the 60s and still refuse to ever use credit cards, computers, cellphones. They live much happier, healthier lives than y'all and haven't missed a thing worth missing.

They don't too, I just wish they'd admit so they can reach the conclusions that stem from there.

Getting clean isn't hard - throw out your smartphone & buy an unlocked burner. Goto local travel store & get fold out road maps; only thing your smartphone has ever done is SMS, twitter and GPS. Get ebook reader, jailbroken. Use desktop PC. Reject dynamic media, read text. DONE

It is not actually all that hard to exit from any of these things, that are supposedly bad also inescapable. they only need the internet, smartphones, bc they're addicted, exactly what they feign signalling against. The vegans are more honorable than these false moralogues.

Truth is, these people don't believe anything, they just want to continue consooming while deflecting some of the guilt they're taught by other products/policies' marketing. If you want to use your smartphone, own it. if u enjoy society's safety, accept it. The cope IS insincere.

I agree but consider Snyder not a director but another technical executer, of Miller’s auteuristic direction thru the comic-as-storyboard; would be as inappropriate to attribute framing decisions to cinematographer or costuming to costume designer, when already defined by Miller.

I RT because I consider the framing evocative, but I’m well aware the posters capped are premiere midwits grasping in the dark for a meaningful thought.

He’s right though, it’s not deep thinking. It’s just a poetic meditation on the mundane with a veneer of critical commentary. It doesn’t actually describe any aspect of the human condition that wasn’t true thousands of years ago in our first use of any tool to extend ourselves.

Great thread but I think it’s wrong to attribute anything to Snyder, who merely managed the direct port from print to film of Frank Miller’s graphic novel; admirable autism, but all the creative decisions and expressed assumptions described derive from Miller nonetheless.

Small children should be treated as short adults after they’re no longer toddlers, if they must be seen/heard at all. I despise feminized modernity’s to elevate the child to the center of any social, except only for them to perform for our pleasure.

I beleive dogs understand most everything we talk about, some combination of intuited body language and ambiently learned verbal signals (same as we all learned our languages), but they simply don’t have any interest in most of it.

By “this way” as in “normally” I mean “incredibly condescending”

I talk to dogs this way, their owners feel bad the dogs wear it with pride.

The smartphone camera is at its best as an tool of self-fascination, an augmented mirror toy, playful photo booth narcissism. Photos of activity, lifestyle, are selfies for those who’ve lost their bodies.

I prefer photographs as fetish of the record, the medium and engine materialistically prominent. The smartphone camera has achieved the truth in mundanity, both of image and access, too much dismerit.

I do not “take photos” simply because I feel it is an extreme inconvenience and heavy burden to unsheathe a smartphone, and even moreso to make use of any photos taken.

yeah

Any "artist" who fails to understand this would have better never attempted express Her voice, in his great corruptions.

"What if they don't know English?"
There is not a man left in the world that does not "know" English (perhaps there is; yet if found, he knows not no longer), the question is only how little or how much do you know? The more you know, the smarter you are. And the less you know...

Expressed verbal IQ in the English medium (and English alone) is an efficient, actionable and highly robust proxy of IQ. If someone speaks bad English, you may functionally assume they are stupid - in fact, it is dysfunctional at scale to not assume so. These are the facts.

The death of an author is just another example of him breaking down the inherent nonsensicalness of a bougie truthism. The idea any book has an "intended meaning", that the book can be "known" and "understood" is demonstrably peak normie.

Barthes liked to observe the normie bourgeoisie and the coded, secondary meaning present in the symbolic objects that generally defined their consumer cosmologies; he also concluded there is no true, universal point of reference to be found outside bougie culture.

The dimwit & topwit arrive to the same conclusion. https://twitter.com/zwartoro/status/1208832913321725952 …

It was a rambunctious, drunken party, and she was a stranger to the friend group, but despite her elegant reservation, whenever she made to speak somehow everyone quieted to listen. Truly manners are a skill that can be trained that give command over the entire social domain.

Once had a dinner party sitting across a japanese girl from very high caste background. Posture straight as a ruler, stable as a statue, each movement small movement very reserved, very measured. She never looked first with her head, but her eyes, letting the neck follow subtly.

lmaoo

33. Make no mistake, the personal vehicle is never leaving, it’s only going to get stronger. Flying cars are genuinely right around the corner. THIS is the revolution of transportation. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1207442603278364672 …

32. Man-powered vehicles will always remain in the realm of sports, children’s toys, and, in utility, the penny rickshaw - for peasants to pull their elites around the city. This is how it always has been, this is how it always will be. They wish to humiliate you.

31. Never forget anyone you see online deriding the car Ubers 5 times a day, relies on their help of friends and family when needed, and limits the scope of their life & activities when they can’t be availed. No one has ever done “just fine” without a car, it’s always a sacrifice

30. They push hard for the bicycle or for public transport - and not the scooter, as Asia - because they seek to limit your range of movement, and to humiliate you. The car was never a problem of urbanism or congestion.

29. All talk of car ITT apply to the motorcycle too; it’s a trade off, which limits mobile owned space for increased velocity. Even the moped is a noble machine. If they really cared about you, these are the alternatives they would be presenting.

28. The congestion & car death problems can both be solved by banning economy cars from the market and making licenses both prohibitively expensive and difficult. The road belongs only to the few proven nobility; let the peasants have their metro.

27. Same driver with true sense of car is also one who can drive on his phone, with his knees, eating a burger or drunk. It’s only those who cannot truly drive who fuck this up - “reckless driving” laws that ban the activity, not bad driving itself, only target the good drivers.

26. Speed limits are the bane of the road, feminized, bureaucratic dissolution of free mobility. They happen to increase accidents, as well; the bugmen who don’t “get” their car get comfortable performing rote repetition, no visceral embodiment with vehicle as speeding demands.

Look, I'm all for traditional urbanism, but only a European, who I'm told today have shriveled balls the size of raisins, would ever find themselves trading in their car for a bicycle, and not horse. Or at least a motorbike, a moped. Asians have that much dignity for themselves.

Did U know those euroesque bikeboys everyone's forced to collectively nanny due to their total non-agency in securing personal safety have a habit of, in all their slave bitterness, running online to complain about carmen "aggression" "hubris""lack of awareness" yadda yadda? LOL

In my younger and more wild days, we would keep a Louisville slugger in the passenger seat to play mailbox baseball with bike lane bitches. Now I just honk honk my airhorn to give a spook - have sent a few tumbling (but obviously not enough). An atmosphere of fear is necessary.

Bicycles are essentially and pathetically European, that soul attracted to self-debasement in exchange for the babyish comforts of safety distributed into a collective welfare, something I wish to exterminate from the American road.

21. Their best criticism of the car is pointing to it trapped in city traffic, its power castrated, brought down close to level of foot peasant. Not being allowed out of the city, they forget there is still an outside in which the car is freed, while they remain castrated.

Important thread...... https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1207747489115316225 …

not even gonna like it

Tell us

2020 lets go

20. They live their lives railroaded, and find it comfortable, safe, reliable, and so wish to push this onto you. Ah, the freedom from the worry of freedom. Slaves, they’re threatened by any who are not intimidated, who relish in freedoms they cannot. Resentful of mastery.

19. Most car cope comes from urbanites, who’ve never truly experienced a sense of open endedness - not even on foot. Their trains and trams take them to no national parks, none of the little towns, the farmlands, the deserts. Only one urban center to another and within them.

This is the cuckoldry of the city. The pedestrians fare only worse.

18. I struggle to imagine how any except a villager lives trapped to only where their feet, government or reliance on less cucked friends can take them. Even as nomadic expat, I've always obtained at least a moped. I must assume these people struggle likewise to imagine freedom..

17. "Im not scared, drunk driving is just dumb. And it risks other's lives!" he says, preserving a life that lost everything worth preserving by its preservation: airpods, knees together, underground train. Overhead, teens drive out to mountain with 6pk, fuck overlooking a valley

16. The same people who reject the car are those who shake in anger at "drunk driving" - they resent men with the testosterone to risk their lives in reckless jubilee, who test the limits of experience. The futurists understood racing as a proxy for warfare.

15. One rejects the car by returning to the workable automobile, the all-mechanical fix 'er up. Or to the horse. Or moving forward, to more experimental forms of mechanical transport. Only those who themselves would demean themselves to the status of a slave herded in chains...

Midwit, you're incorrectly wielding a received concept of masculinity.

14. Modern urbanism is definitely a crisis; public transport as a COMPANION to personal transport, to fill for long-distance travel, commute within dense city neighborhoods & to support inner city's slave caste, is the solution. Banning personal transport, however, is mega POZ

13. Pure-blooded Americans, being globally higher caste as a nation, should also take a serious consideration into never allowing themselves to be packed into anything like a slave's bus. There is always a humane alternative. Do not denigrate yourself to their level.

12. The higher castes should never, ever settle for being packed like canned sardines with the commoners, in the subway, in the bus. Until they offer first class options for all their "public transport", do not consider their push as anything but insidious communism.

Many american midwits try to imitate European things to try to appear more cultured than their peers, and learning the metric system is usually the meme they fall for. The "imperial is good, actually" pill is potent https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1165387707494928384?s=20 …

11. Consider the bicyclist, that irrefutably european bugman, who snidely complains about "bad drivers" making the road "dangerous", while his entire existence on the road demands that all vehicles make effort to preserve him. He places his safety in their hands, not his own.

10. Anti-automobilism betrays the urbanite's r-selected malaise. They understand nothing of the country's frontierism, the need for ownership and understanding of one's own tools. They feel no anxiety giving up all agency unto the city. As long as it gets them to the wine bar...

9. Public transportists betray the slave's democratizing impulse; they want the CEO make same dreadful bus commute as their smellbad wagies. Issue with congestion in the city is not lack of equality, but too much of it. Force the poors into subway and how the roads become clear!

8. Understand relationship between car & road is not in the frame of "urbanism", of a "people's urbanism" (read: peasant urbanism), but of the BOAT and SEA, the HORSE and PLAIN. It's the city that is the problem, not the car. Trust no trad claimants that fail to understand this!

7. The car is modern man's nomadic home; public transport seeks to reject owned space. For the landless peasant, their car is the only space you truly own. Bugman European doesn't have ANY place to call their own: no house, no car. They don't even have a nation to call their own.

6. Reject "traditional urbanists", and their insecurity around the car, knowing they are not traditionalist, but merely EURO urbanists, who burn with resentment to America's mogging. The truth: only backwater towns & peasantry ever lived "walking": they walked amongst horseshit.

5. The car is no alien artifact of industrial modernity. It is the direct successor of the horse and horsecarriage, who's had its place at the top of our urbanism since the time of Rome. As a horse, the car is a landed man's livelihood and freedom.

4. The car a perfect consumer encapsulation of engineering, a self-embodiment of male technics - it will never be understood by the woman, as she'll never computers, only usable by imitation of surface action/reactions, no understanding of machine's sensitive inner workings.

3. Man has always extended himself with (bio)mechnical appendage, from throwing stick to the riding horse to  catapult, boat; the automobile is peak & culmination of this rich, virile military-techno tradition. It speaks much to any who reject it as "dangerous", "unsustainable".

2. The car is a perfect union of man and technics, of man and machine. in driving, the car becomes an appendage of the body, a new set of muscles, intuitively sensed, organically respondent. Beacon of futurism not only in velocity: truly to drive the car is to become a cyborg.

1. The car is the ultimate expression of speed and velocity, innate, primal taste for extreme experience that all malekind share. Never trust any "man" who hesitates behind the wheel, who advocates for its dismantlement or control, who sees no purpose to speed, reckless speed.

We live in a slave world, the elite are not masterly, and the virtuous live among the slaves. By deconstructing the normie, I reach out to those fallen nobles who believed themselves alone in the world.

The problem is not the slave caste's illiteracy, but that they've been allowed a false pretense of literacy, destroying it in the process. Literary disenfranchisement - of all prose, including the WWW - is the solution. https://twitter.com/Lucin_4/status/1207529605789372416 …

Each has their own use and goals for being here.

Most everything I discuss has already been covered in earlier one-sentence quips, I'm now expanding the knowledge for those who weren't yet ready to read them. It's always a balance of space, density and accessibility.

As much as necessary. You wouldn't know about that until you reach there, though.

Fella my threads are 100 posts, all run up against the char max. With no naivety I am as dense as I need to be: as dense as possible.

This is, of course, the nature of normie communication; being spoke over by the memetic complexes they are host to, not intelligibly, but impulsive reaction by trained verbal heuristics. And they "write" and "read" just as they talk, having never been taught literacy.

I make point of selecting most accurate word for meaning intended & lower to simpler alt when possible, partly bc space is short, partly bc i detest obfuscated vocab. But if u can't read, u can't see the difference, u can only repeat received meme in response to surface signals. https://twitter.com/trisidorou/status/1207523482852102144 …

83. You can't easily estimate the many complex factors deciding if an arrow hits a target, so you roll, abstracting  chaotic simulation. You can immediately know if a boulder of X properties can be moved by a PC with Y properties. No reason to roll, either it moves or it doesn't.

82. The DM simulates a virtual world & translate player actions logically within it. Rolling is ONLY ever to 1. model randomness, 2. abstract chaotic complexity. Nu-skoolers use it a 3rd, WRONG, way: to fudge ambiguous DM 
adjudications, fundamentally misunderstanding the TTRPG.

81. Nu-D&D's "skill tests" are illogical knowing skills = innate ability. What they mean to test is trained experience, e.g. HD; represented by PC's level title. Moving a boulder is not STR test, but TITLE test. Only a Hero, maybe DEMIGOD can move this, not mere veteran mercenary

80. Importance of the "Level Title" in adjucating non-mechanically defined "feats" is underappreciated. You must consider the difference of a HD1 "Veteran" Fighter vs a HD3 HERO in all interactions, in their image to NPC's, in their ability to engage in their environment.

79. Player Level (HD), increased through XP, is the abstraction of experience gained over time. No matter how much life experience you undergo, your stats - your inborn talent - won't change; though high talen does result in increased rate of XP change - geniuses train faster.

78. PC stats represent a PC's genetic heritage, their innate capability - it should never be adjusted except by means of magic, unless you genuinely mean to transmogrify the character. +2 CHA is literally a new face, +2 INT higher IQ, not simply more knowledge.

Exactly my point. Pretty much everyone in the millenial/zoomer generation that tried to get into D&D was tricked into a false spinoff just because WotC wanted to make $$$ by ripping the brand name, and the truth that this shit isn't the D&D you heard so much about was memoryholed

D&D’s always suffered from a lack of clarity. B/X did remain supported and in print until 1995, but it was labeled as “Basic” edition to AD&D’s “advanced”, when really they were separate games by release of 2e. 3e was first to make its nu-skool “official” d&d, memoryholing OD&D.

American, peak predating 1983

Please recommend me country singers.

My main point is that nu skool isn't actually D&D, its a niche spinoff that happened to take its copyright; many potential players are confused by this and turned off due to its autism when all they really wanted was D&D. You're still free to play your erotic roleplay or whatever

Why yes, I have noticed. They don't resent "intolerance" - which they're happy to perform - it's rejecting their own 
brand of gatekeeping, and undoing the damage their outsider entryism has caused. Just pointing out there's a difference between D&D and nu-D&D puts them in crisis  https://twitter.com/cirsova/status/1207018860945297410 … pic.twitter.com/sagpUoNegJ

77. Modules/adventures are only for stealing ideas from. If u actually run them, except maybe with heavy modification or a tournament context, you're a fool. Modules are fundamentally incompatible with play of D&D, & largely responsible for its distortion, to better sell modules.

D&D was borne directly out of the medieval wargame, Chainmail, designed and released as a mod to the rules for dungeon diving play. Also, AD&D is compatible with OD&D and B/X with trivial conversion. This guy has no idea what he's talking about.

i seen them around and theyre goscha wearing normies. heard later they've a rep for cribbing their clout from other peoples digging, makes sense. probably from places like  http://are.na

76. D&D has 4 editions:
1. OD&D aka 0e. The original 3LBB, white box
2. D&D B/X - Holmes, Moldvay/Cook. Cleaned up OD&D with some gaps filled
3. AD&D 1e - heavily houseruled D&D
4. AD&D 2e - Diablo adaptation

Ignore the various later unrelated, shortlived spinoffs branded “D&D”.

they're not. also they're fuckb0ys lol

No

no. I yell

My guess is it wouldn't be satisfying due to the dilution, but now I'm curious to try it

Hot shower and a beer is its own satisfaction. Sometimes I crouch in the corner and let the water pour over my head, sobbing. Sometimes I take a bath. I have also been meaning to try 'orange in the shower'. They are all therapies with each their own advantages.

Yet I can collect my thoughts and emotions long enough to form a coherent argument, and you can't.

lmfao. the master/slave typologies are the same in any network

Cold tolerance is the greatest mog, it lies in direct rejection to manmade technology's earliest comfort. used to see who could stay longest out nude on the balcony in winter winds, but learning about cold showers hijacked this game. The body can be trained in every dimension.

You don't need to worry, I wouldn't join your 5e table expecting D&D, because I know better. I just pity the many people you've probably turned away from the game by introducing them to an entirely different one under false pretenses.

ur my hook

75. FromSoft's King's Field series, and its next gen spiritual successor in the "Souls" series, are probably the most solid videogame adaptations of real D&D yet, outside of roguelikes.

74. This is why, counterintuitively, earliest cRPG's carry more of D&D's true character - exploration and resource management, not simply a killing grind + "plot" - than later ones do, even tho computational limitations limiting player's interactions would've been more prominent.

73. A funny feedback loop occurred in the process of D&D's corruption, with CRPG videogames - e.g. roguelikes, later, Wizardy, Baldur's Gate - trying to capture D&D into a videogame. Then 3e tried to capture the computer game into D&D, producing a PnP Baldur's Gate - "rollplay".

72. Only reason we moved from such a simple, elegantly deep game was commercial interest; if people can play for decades with just 1 book, where's the profit? So they pushed linear modules, heroic campaigns, and shit to sell to players. No reason for the "hobbyists" to support it

Useful for reference, but it stays behind DM screen. Players have saving throws written on their char sheet, but re: combat, I prefer not stating exact number they're rolling for, just let them know if the roll hits; they can ask if the opponent looks tough or weak (high/low AC)

Appendix A*, capped and attached here: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1206695667126566913?s=20 …

71. Entry cost to real D&D is a couple hours max:
1. download & read Labryinth Lord ruleset (~100 pg)
2. grab graph paper & dice
3. use DMG Appendix A to generate 2 dungeon floors
4. key in dungeon with LL's stocking rules
5. call some friends over
6. play game pic.twitter.com/A369UVg89A

70. Entry cost to nu "D&D" is dreadful for both DM's & players:
1. buy & read DM guide + Player handbook (~700 pg)
2. find friends to commit 4 hrs/wk indefinitely
3. make them buy & read PHB
4. buy & prep official adventures
5. 2hr's chargen
6. play..and everyone's disappointed

this is the perfect player. download and read Labryinth Lord for rules, and AD&D's Dungeon Master's Guide just for reference, then DMG's appendix G to produce 2 floors to a dungeon. dm me if u have questions.

It'll be bumpy but not much. everyone got their start at 12 having half-read the rules, the game plays itself. the only real trouble is people are very insecure today and often won't let themselves get "into" it and actually play. alcohol helps them loosen up

if i go deaf tho just end me i do not fw the deaf

Women can be replaced with God.

69. 5e will never be a funnel into the oldschool. Its a funnel for WotC to get kids who want to play D&D throwing $$ at starter sets, some modules, adventures, then realizing it sucks & nothing like what they expected & leaving after a year. You know what they expected? Real D&D.

68. D&D is for houseruling, but there's a core system, a set of very elegantly defined platonic assumptions that generate the TTRPG experience. Houserules add onto and around them. The nu skool throws them out and replaces them. It's a different game, and yes, it's a bad one.

67. Real D&D is niche only bc only people who know it are in the nu skool. nu-D&D is trash & you know it - let em have it. Real D&D is extremely accessible, easily grokked, low investment, its for thousands of kids who wanna play D&D, get stuck with nu skool, & rightfully hate it

66. The only reason D&D ever got twisted into the abomination it is now was in commercial pursuit to sell adventure-based modules. Everyone in the old school knows this, they're just too afraid to scare newbies away to say it. 3e+ is not the same game, they just stole the name.

65. There's no reason to pussy foot around and let people take claim to what's yours. It's fact of history TSR experienced a commercial takeover by non-gamers, and then the copyright was gnabbed by equally exploitative WotC. The game's heritage & reputation as marketing gimmick.

64. Real D&D is not a niche game. Nu-D&D is, probly because it sucks. Consider: D&D was wildly popular in the 80s & culturally prominent in mainstream with every walk of life. Nu skool is exclusively played in self-contained RPG community of weirdo geeks. Who is the strong horse?

63. A lot of people in the old school community are shocked by this thread's absolutism, worried it will scare new schoolers away with fears of pretentiousness. There is nothing pretentious about pointing out a game claiming to be "D&D" as a marketing gimmick is not actually D&D.

I mean, what this guy wants is OSR; invariably all complaints about D&D are about things that were added afterwards onto the original game. You don't need some indie to fix it, just play the real thing; people just aren't aware it's an option.

I only tell people this to guys who blame women. They need to understand their experience with women are consistently sour because they're bad men ('if everyone you meet is an asshole...'); passing this stage, the union of man and woman is necessary for achieving a higher state.

Conspiracy, the greatest performance art, is very malleable. I encourage you subscribe to alt hypotheses; Truth's only be found in the inbetween. the stamp of Science is merely institutional, it represents no inherent accuracy. Only fruits of Tradition's heuristics are actionable

Conspiracy theory lies in the realm of what can be analyzed but not actionably predictive in areas of high obfuscation, forcing consilience as the standard of evidence: confirmation bias as a method.  All scientific paradigms, dug deep enough, nest on a foundation of conspiracy.

Essentially any "scientific" theory can be conceptually reversed and maintain the same degree of plausibility and actionable functionality (note: engineering stands above "science"), especially true for anything relating to the human spirit. This leads all the way down to animism

As easily as evidence of genetic inheritance can be explained by structural cultural conditions, evidence of cultural influence can be by transmogrification. Evolution of new species may largely be hybridization, or it may not. You get to decide, science can rationalize anything.

The construction of internally consistent frameworks whose disconnections with observable reality can be explained away with vague, presently unprovable hypotheses is THE method of science, and there's nothing stopping you from designing your own equally robust alternatives. pic.twitter.com/Pxp8eSZXmu

The only non-sophistic use of signed quotation is to discuss content in the context of the author, or as excerpt, with the author noted only as reference for further research.

You post excerpts, not quotes. not the same thing. also I'm probably the one that even reads them. lol

the problem isn't who youre quoting, it's the fact that you are, and even worse, leaning on his name. detestable practice that damages the word of the people who hope to venerate, something that can only come from the self-hating man who knows he will never himself be of quote.

A woman in male company is a crisis. And truly female company, women, and women alone....a terrible mistake. It should never be permitted, or suffer unto horrors.

And what of male company? A delicate thing: a game, of banter; or a tool, of production - only when needed, and there is often no need. Banter, a wonder, but only for the best of men. With men who are not so good, perhaps not even men, they induce an effectively mixed company.

A man in female company enjoys a great game, one second only to that which begins when the female company dwindles to one. Yet mixed company is inanity, hopefully only short-lived formality before the genders self-organize into discrimination. West has largely forgotten this art. https://twitter.com/w_guppy/status/1206625544428773377 …

Still chuckle when I think about the /vg/ generals traumatized by me, paranoiacally accusing each other of being my alt, locking down their servers at any hint I might have returned, the flame forever continued by trolls exploiting their fear and pretending to be me months later.

haters vs stan camps are always same, too. haters are ugly, poor character, slavish, whiners who push degeneration in the community while cancelling truth. The stans are noble old heads. My “opinions” happen to always align with truth, and snakes anywhere are burned by the truth.

Find it kind of funny find it kind of sad that no matter what community wandering spirit Miya innocently sticks her nose into, response is always the same: chaos, confusion, and division into both hatred & stanning. I may wander off to new pastures..but they are forever marked...

Sure. I wouldn’t normally but I have no stake in this community. That was @dungeonhome. I’m curious who are all the people he talks about talking about me, he was only one to gather the courage to say something directly to me. even if he ran away before I could respond.....

Exactly. The depth emerges in play, you’ll never do better designing it artificially beforehand no matter how many hours you invest. This holds true for everything from setting to a PC’s backstory.

The “1 like =“ version, however, is a DOA corruption. It is not simply the 1 RT with less upfront cost to your followers; it loses the entire viral hijacking that makes the latter meaningful. I highly advise against this midwit devolution, be confident even if you expect few RTs.

Me too tho?

It’s an entirely different game. They just use the name as a marketing gimmick, hoping to trick the unknowing public into getting the wrong version for a quick buck, turning off countless people from playing real D&D. There’s no reason to support it.

Many interest in D&D in zoomer gen, but few resources directing them to true old school. They get directed to new school and are told “this is D&D”, hate it bc it objectively sucks, never go near it again, 4ever confused why it’s nothing like all the old stories they heard about.

Irony is a product of postmodern destabilization, evading a commitment to any core. The true right re-establishes objectivity in eternal ideals of Truth & Beauty - it calls for assertion, not distancing.

62. I've heard some nu-skool DM's gone so low as to demand money for DM'ing. DM'ing isn't a job, it's not hard, doesn't require creativity or effort (but it helps). All DM's got their start bc they wanted to play the most of their friend group. Suck it up & make them bring beer.

61. The meat of your time with background prep should only be in coming up with cool puzzles and cool monsters. Ideally, you wouldn't come up with anything, and just steal all of it, modified to your own context.

60. A DM shouldn't spend more 30 minutes prepping before any session. A player shouldn't spend more than the time it takes to RSVP. If your game is one that you can't run a bit drunk, or hungover, you need to rethink your approach.

59. Puzzle "traps" are essential to a memorable dungeon. Riddles don't count. A good puzzle is a complication which has a large multitude of solutions, not only one. A gold statue on perfectly tuned pressure plate. A Zeno hallway that exponentially doubles in length on each step.

58. A good trap telegraphs its danger. It should punish incautious play, not simply bad luck. Great traps often present good bait, that tests the player's greed against their caution.

They should follow the basic ethos and structure of a racial class as in OD&D. Minimum stat restriction (to ensure rarity of non-humans), 1-2 unique advantages (e.g. nightvision) and equivalent disadvantages (e.g. no armor).

57. There is no space for "rules lawyering" in true D&D. The players know only the internal logic of the simulation as their PC's experience it. You can and should adjunct freely all edge-cases. Your responsibility is only to maintain its internally consistent logic.

56. Chargen should be very simple, bc it's playerfacing. This doesn't mean it needs to be restricted. If a player wants to play random non-human race, u can let him - come up with specifics on the spot, or verbally offer them some options. But don't let them pore over a long list

 https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1205952708089237505?s=20 …

55. DM rolls all dice behind the screen. He rolls every turn for random encounters, for triggering traps, finding hidden doors. The only information players receive is the sounds of a roll occurring, and actions that happen in-game. It is a cardinal sin to lie about the results.

54. Monsters aren't always hostile. You should always roll on a reaction table to see if they attack, are cautious or neutral/friendly. Fighting is not the answer, it's a last resort to players. They can run, and distract dumb monsters with food, smart monsters with treasure.

53. Faction play is the easiest way to get disinterested players engaged. It's endlessly complex and runs itself.

52. Don't be too autistic simulating a realistic dungeon ecology. Ecology is just a prompt for the imagination; the dungeon is always underworldy, though, and never fully logical to the players. You want a good 20% gonzo - genre mash, time travel, reference pop culture.

51. Be sure to simulate time passing between sessions, and a living dungeon responding to player activity. Kobolds set freshs traps..walls  damaged opening new passages.. decimated nest might result in another monster's rising in population...good haul makes local economy boom...

loool

A low-level IRS auditor discovers contact with alien life had been made by automated decentralized corporations and regular extraterrestrial trade quietly incorporated into the high-frequency, AI economy some years ago. It seems perversely obvious when you think about it.

I would like to build a dungeon cuisine module one day.

eg.
"You proceed down the hallway 10 feet. 20 feet. 30 feet. 10 feet ahead, the hallway opens into a room. [Enter the room]. The room is 30 feet wide, 10 feet to both sides, and the wall ahead is 20 feet forward. There is a door on the left wall."
etc

The DM keeps his drawn & keyed maps behind the screen, and can mentally track or use some kind of chit to note where they are in the procession. The players have their own graph paper that they map out as the DM verbally describes using the 10x10" per square standard

50. Another ex is defining a PC's personality. The 6 stats are distillations of entire archetypal possibilities of man. What is high STR high CHA low INT fighter, but a heroic brute? & so on. Speculating the abstraction provides much more possibility than the explicitly detailed.

49. One example of this is the wandering monsters list. A simple chart for populating a floor or area - but also one that characterizes its entire internal ecosystem, possibly even its factions, politics & history. Prepare a list and an entire natural history unfolds before you.

48. D&D is a very elegantly designed game, so the subtle manifestations of its deceptively simple systems were often misunderstood and thrown out in exchange for artificial complexity, bloated rulesets which conversely restrict its much deeper possibility of emergent complexity.

47. It's a mistake to think old school style is devoid of the nu skool's flavor or story. Former's is simply emergent, drawn out organically in play, thru players engaging in a simulation; while latter is forced, artificially authored by egos of DMs and players' endless fudge.

 https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1206051364553388032?s=20 …

46. The megadungeon's beauty is in repetition. A party's experience with each floor begins nervously penetrating the unknown, but with repeated plays, the darkness is illuminated. Yet, as it becomes known, the treasure is exhausted - pushing the frontier ever further.

45. Good practice to give each floor a subtle theme and flavor; gives party a sense of exploring new territory as they go deeper; also hints when the mazes & machinations have unknowingly moved them between floors. Traditionally, flavor stems directly from wandering monster list.

44. 1/10 or so not empty rooms, should be "unique"; memorable setpieces, traps. Steal liberally - from modules, movies, books, dreams, whatever. I also recommend having one larger, major, dramatic setpiece room for each floor - it serves as major navigational reference.

43. Mundanity is a feature, not a bug. The dangerous dungeon is explored slowly, cautiously. In the darkness, the algorithm is obscured. Simple lines and boxes become a dark, confusing maze in play. Remember - most rooms (1/3) are empty! The ones that aren't, u often wish were...

now tht u mention it doe 😂

#miya when i loggmg in twtr .. pic.twitter.com/MIyBCo8bgl

yea!

No idea but probably not. It’s just OD&D in space western setting and additional rules related to that.

Just adjust imported stats to d6. An AD&D weapon is 1d8? Now it’s 1d6. monster’s hd d4? d6. If you want to a d20 roll under skill check, just do 3d6 instead. The positive: damage directly matches HD, and you get smoother bell curve scaling. Negative: players don’t get funky dice.

Traveler is good for this, but it is weighty not like the D&D I describe ITT. Stars without Number, however, is D&D-Traveler

Ecofascists who stan Ted Kacszynski’s critique of industrial technology, Pentti Linkola’s deep ecology.

An elegant double subversion, of both content monetization, by locking content in an inverted exchange - free is non-monetary and content non-private - and twitter’s engagement interface, by twisting RT into a tool of value-exchange rather than empty social expression.

Twitter itself is a microblog prompt, sadly detourned into nefarious dopamine mindcontrol. “1 like =“ is maladaptation by the low-confident, but “1 RT =“ subverts virality, resulting in extended engagement for same material. An elegant pseudo-monetization thru attention economy. https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205357296714280962 …

It’s really amazing how much the game got confused just because of the realities of module publishing.

Also, good megadungeon inspo gonna save those

OD&D. Specifically D&D B/X Moldvay 81, d6 only. I crib some stuff I like from AD&D and Lamentations of the Flame Princess, but AD&D as it is, even just 1e, is too much overhead for my taste.

It makes perfect sense when the game revolves around a megadungeon.

42. D&D is the ultimate game. It’s a virtual reality, simulated by paper, pen, dice and the DM’s brain, projected into a theater of the mind verbally. With such open endedness, its goal must be direct (treasure) and the challenge immense (dungeon) to organically emerge deep play.

41. The dungeon exists in an underworld, where things get weirded. Things don’t need to make sense here. There should be a fundamental aura of otherworldliness, spiritual awe, the unknown, that only increases the deeper you go.

40. D&D’s assumes setting is throughly, unapologetically american. It’s fundamentally the Wild West, with fantasy flavor. The megadungeon is the gold mine in the lawless frontiers, the players are adventures are seeking fame & fortune at high risk, assisted only by a pop up town.

Maybe in a month or two, cud be fun

39. The megadungeon IS d&d. Without it there is no episodic play, goal of treasure is obscured, little value to meta world knowledge. But it doesnt need to be a dungeon per se - a castle can be a dungeon, a city, a forest. “Dungeon” is not what’s important - mega is.

38. There is a serious gap today for male recreational clubs outside of physical exercise. No more art salons, no reading clubs, no frequented lounges or bars. Weekly D&D is perfect, as a no-commitment dungeon dive to exercise the imagination & test ingenuity in team sport.

37. There are 2 kinds of roleplay. Nu skool "roleplay" seeks to be amateur theatre, an actor in play, vehicle for some kind of plot. Oldschool roleplay is just realistically embodying a character within his environment, responding as you would if it was IRL. Learn the difference.

36. 👇 pic.twitter.com/Iw462M8kfs

Classic Traveller. On the more new school side, I've read through Mouse Guard & Ryuutama and thought about trying it if I had to play with younger players. Have not played Call of Cthulhu but I'd like to, though I don't think I could run it well. Shadowrun looks fun too

The only reason I make a point of pointing it out is I see new schoolers try to make the claim TTRPG is unjustly dominated by white men, people are secretly racist and pushing out minorities. They built the entire hobby, it follows they would dominate it.

Citation for D&D coming from wargaming tradition pioneered by white males is the history of wargaming. Prussia, Kriegspiel to HG Well's miniature wargaming, America and UK with work of Jack Scruby, Donald Featherstone. Citation for D&D being pulp syncretism is Appendix N. https://twitter.com/JohnsonJeffro/status/1205955173207724032 …

35. True D&D is very easy to grok for any newbie, by the way, probably because it's true. You can play with normies, you can play with boomers, you can play with fratboys, stoners, it all flows. Only that have trouble with it are autists bred on nu-skool. Dying teaches them quick

34. Nu-skool players are spoiled, bc games are tied to campaigns, you can't simply get rid of a player. You can't even let him get killed. True D&D is an open table. You can, and must, be ruthless with your table. If they're annoying, just remove them from the invite list. lol

33. I recommend having a FB group or mailing list for IRL play. This way you can simply post saying you want to have a game on this night, and anyone who wants to come can RSVP and show up. Demand they bring either a 6-pack or snacks, also.

32. true D&D can be easily played online, btw. You only need VC for the players, and something to share maps on. Skype, Discord, etc. work fine, the mapper can do it digitally or physically and just upload the current version when asked.

31. Other house rules:
- 1 sentence limit to backstory +1 sentence per level
- Once per session, characters may drink hard liquor to gain 1d6 temporary HP that last for duration of next combat
- M-U get minor free-use cantrips related to their spell, e.g. fireball = flick lighter

30. D&D is for houseruling. Every home game should tack on cool stuff and toy with interesting ideas, classes. This is a natural development of the game - as long as you don't reject the true, eternal principles outlined in this thread. Example - I use ONLY six sided die.

29. The dungeon SHOULD be brutally difficult, but reasonably so, to force the players to play with extreme caution and resourcefulness. There is nothing else you need to do to extract good play out of players.

28. The megadungeon is a persistent entity. You can have multiple, random groups enter it; any thing they change or do persist for later groups (obviously repopulate dungeon as time passes). Interesting meta game develops in sharing knowledge and maps of the dungeon.

27. Other essential job is the mapper, possibly multiple (the map is a real object in game! if he gets destroyed, the map may be lost with it. It can also be traded between playing groups). If ur players don't use a map and still survive fine, your dungeon isn't maze like enough.

26. Groups can get as big as 20. How? Easy, assign a pointman who is responsible for leading the group's actions for any standard move that doesn't call for a debate. The majority of the game should be call and response between DM and point man. "We go left, we open door, etc"

25. The character of the D&D is of the scampish grave robber, the resourceful thief, diving into the dungeon and escaping with whatever he can grab - blowing it all in town and doing it again. High risk/high reward/high T adventuring. Not the valiant demigod knight.

24. D&D is a very elegantly designed system, balancing perfectly an objective gamic goal (gold) with complex concerns to manage. Everything to follow has been a degeneration of its ultimate purity.

23. The DM does not need to guide the players or influence the game towards anything. They'll learn through trial and error. If they run headfirst into unnecessary fights with monsters, they'll quickly realize it's pointless, that the alternative is almost always preferable.

22. Players have no skills to learn, or rolls to make using them. They can do anything they can describe reasonably. If involves luck, e.g. shooting an arrow at a distant target, the DM will roll behind the screen to adjunct if it lands. Players only roll for chargen and combat.

21. Your players do not need any prep to play. Player-facing rules are cancer. Ideally they would never see anything beyond their character sheet and their own drawn map.

20. To build a megadungeon, draw out a series of rooms (or use generator in DMG Appendix A), and key it using the monsters, treasures, traps assortment in your rulebook. Do only level 1 and 2 at first, and add some stairways in-between them. Ensure interconnectivity! Done. pic.twitter.com/8J4p9Banbj

19. If you want to play, just google Labryinth Lord PDF. It's a free no-copyright clone of D&D B/X (slightly revised version of first release that fills in some missing rules). Read through the rules, get some graph paper and dice and call some friends over.

18. The TTRPG as a concept is perfectly valid today, not a retro nostalgia. What it does is no less than simulate a virtual world. This will be the last game to be digitized. The DM acts as an AI supercomputer, rationalizing any possible action within their modeled world.

17. The original D&D comes from a long tradition of white, male wargaming. The original publication is a masterpiece of postmodern fiction, syncretizing various evocative strains of the American pulp imagination - swords & sorcery, westerns, etc. It is bred of Conan, not LOTR.

16. D&D is great as a male social club, a weekly gathering of the bros. It should be played with alcohol and cigarettes, with the same buddies you might play poker with. Run dungeon synth in the background.

15. True D&D is a game you can sit own and play with any group of men spontaneously. The only thing you need on hand to run a game is your megadungeon as a set of graph paper, some dice and pencil and paper. New players can learn to play in minutes.

14. True D&D is a game that should only be played with men. It is a rationalist simulation of a tense, dangerous environment that demands high teamwork, minimal ego. New D&D is so drastically different because it is feminized, filled with numales and women.

13. The DM's only job is to simulate a virtual environment and convey the model accurately for the players to engage with. Everything interesting in the game emerges from this - he should never fudge dice or try to lead a story.

12. D&D play is entirely about 3 things: risk/reward management, resource management, and clever play. The player is a weak human in a monstrous underworld, he is a wimpy grave robber. He must be very resourceful to come out alive with treasure. This is a game of player skill.

11. The dungeon is a set of labyrinthine hallways rooms containing either monsters, treasures, traps or, most commonly, nothing. Every floor deeper has higher level monsters, and higher level treasure. The players have the agency to risk/reward.

10. Chargen takes less than 10 minutes. You roll 3d6 down the line, STR WIS INT DEX CON CHA, give yourself a name, pick between fighter, mage, cleric, dwarf or elf. That's it. Your character's "story" is defined by his actions, in a history of play, not a written backstory.

9. Characters die easily. Very easily. At level 1, they are considered an average human. At level 2, a strongman, like a body builder. Only at level 3, do they begin to approach a strength of note. And they're fighting horrible monsters in the dark unknown. They die easily.

8. All sessions begin in the town & end in the town; or somewhere lost in the dungeon - if you don't make it out by the end of the session, your character is dead. Simple as.

7. Parties need not be consistent. They can be as small as 1 and as large as 20 and can change between every game.

6. True D&D is not a campaign. It's episodic. Map is a megadungeon, so large & complex it can be dived into in EVERY session without being exhausted. The village attached is merely a base of operations. The setting, the NPCs, all are side flavor for the goal: treasure in dungeon.

5. True D&D is a simulation of dungeon diving for treasure. Killing monsters is not the goal, developing story is not the goal. Treasure is the goal, and the DM's job is to simulate its obstacle course. Monsters are just one obstacle. True D&D gives exp for gold, nothing else.

4. This must be by design. You've heard the stories: 2 hours spent reading rules to roll up some lame character & then subjected to autistic story, forced to role-play theatrics. campaign falls apart because everyone couldn't meet at same time. This is WRONG! This is NOT D&D!

3. Real D&D, as it was played in the late 70s thru the 80s, D&D that was a cultural phenomenon, your dad’s d&d, is nothing like the nu-skool. The cringe cancer of the nu-skool destruction of d&d has stolen 2 generations of ppl from their RIGHT to the tabletop communion.

2. D&D started to shift in character towards the nu-skool in the mid 80s, with AD&D 2e, and got totally pozzed by the 90s. The game became the cancer you see today: big rulebooks, elaborate characters, stories, player acting, etc. This is poz, NOT d&d!

1. Lets be clear, all editions after AD&D are not D&D. They’re a different game altogether that happened to steal the copyright to the name. If you’ve only played 3e, PF, 4e, 5e, you’ve never actually played D&D. You should try it sometime.

0. D&D, done right, is actually very trad & very based. It’s something I believe all in the rw sphere should be playing, a recreational parallel to the brotherhood of the gym, filling the sorely lacking role of the male social club. The only problem is the D&D you know is wrong.

There has never ever been a meme to originate in twitter to escape twitter. One-off viral jokes reposted to IG are not memes, FYI, they’re funnyjunk; you can make it racist, but it’s still blacktwitter. Only influence rw twitter has ever had is thru the long shadow of anonymous.

Yang op existed on multiple self-reflective axes. Inot as simple as it was astroturfed, or it was a blackpill troll, or cloutfiends hopping bandwagons, or trolled newf*gs. It was all of them. /pol/ started the op, they astroturfed it, grifters jumped on it, people fell 4 it.

need to see a psych and claim ADHD. use word of mouth to find someone who prescribes easily, research symptoms to claim you have them. always tell them u take it daily, but dont, and say its not much effective if u want more. I'd recommend researching RC meth instead

Remember: Adderall goes up the nose not down the throat!

Only problem with prescribed speed is constancy, tolerance means daily intake only slows you down. Disperse your speed intake for proper futurist gains: occasional abuse, not regular use. https://twitter.com/toad_spotted/status/1205573084717232128 …

Doubtful. What makes you believe this?

Silicon Valley elite do flirt w “dangerous” ideas much more often than you’d expect by their sanitized public-facing images. Some deep in their scene have reached out to me anonymously but also you see it revealed in anecdotes like Moldbug bringing BAM to dinner party with Thiel.

Andreessen’s been following me since I was sub 2k but I’ve never seen him engage any of my posts. IIRC he used to flirt a bit w the NRx scene here on twitter, which does better to prove OP’s point, as Thiel never did despite them stanning him as their ideology’s potential patron.

Lmao

u are misunderstanding. i dont listen to techno at home. i skimmed thru that track on a phone with tin speakers. i was linking the look not the recording, the scene and sound it represents. id link hard cuts but i deleted my library and idr

No there’s a trendy audiophile album camp now, labels like PAN follow in the footsteps of Warp, idm for the bedroom. Tapeshit is a result of techno converging on noise, as well ghetto house and black metal influences of the present wave.

I think it’s a good idea

are you unaware vinyl and tape revivalist labels/collectors are a thing

what the fuck!

i dont think you understand. its a pirate tape of a live show, or possibly larping as such. not some studio album released on vinyl for audiophiles. this is true tekno.

thinking about hakan

its for basements not 4 bedrooms

sumthn like it

goood. i was hurt. i like ur new name btw. i know what it references... very clever..

and oh i had you confused with someone else. im not sure for how long this happens a lot to me. but you should be my mutual I think youre cute

ah I see. youre mistaken. maga wouldnt draw their own physiognomy ugly, the meme originates from /pol/ comparing trumpkins to tru-/pol/. speech bubbles are edited after, possibly by other meme before reaching lefty; but left definitely wrote hat line: the cringe "?!" is give away

all strawmans are by definition constructing the opponent's argument. did you unfollow me over this dumb thread

It's all so drearily easy and yet these extremely online wannabees really invest years of their lives into reading fucking Pitchfork and tinymixtapes, all to go to fucking death grips and bladee shows LOL

CANT SAY IM WRONG!

They all follow the same 5 labels, if u have a modicum of taste u can tune into the "underground" (NOTE:  "underground" today is entirely globalized - same avant shit in Berlin is in London, in Istanbul). know the few names u need to pass as kool & yes u will get to fuck models

If you want to be KOOL literally all you need to do is dress in dickies & black coats & use FB to find the underground techno or noise shows (yes, they srsly organize on FB LOL). this holds true GLOBALLY. I'm not kidding this all u need to meet worlwide trust fund/artist elite.

artboys be spending their teens online carefully cultivating refined portfolios of aesthetic taste waiting for day they can impress an art girl with refinement & depth, only to learn they all get their "taste" from insta & ex-boyfriends & everything beyond a starter pack is noise

Can confirm all aesthetics gfs - lit, mu, tv, po, ic - are whores + shit taste, u don't need to bother past entry level. only ones w good taste took it from ex bf. If u want to fuck an art girl in any city in world just show up to local techno show & stand in smoking alley. done.

lol. good post

This is the transition phase from midwit to topwit. Final stage of aestheticism is rejecting recorded media altogether and entering anti-art, art of the world, bliss.

urbit's already had a 'return to roots' schism?

the only reason they read books is because they think it'll help them craft an identity that will get them laid. same reason anyone gets "into" music

PUA's value faking only works on low value women. betas should just spend the energy working on themselves, they'll go much further

he makes joke calling it 'lover'. this is just abuse. lol

you're right for healthy relationships, but OP is describing pimp game, it's for turning girls into mindbroken slaves. healthy alpha dicking lifts a girls up, makes her strive to be wife material, she thrives; this perversion does opposite, turns girl into empty puddle.

The "4 Hour Life" is new, and it does mean we have less time for "Life" today, but not because we have little Life-time between Sleep-time & Work-time, but because Life has been separated from Work, which, historically, as working-life, was 16 hours—not 8, not 4. https://twitter.com/ElijahDelMedigo/status/1204916126481866759 …

It holds true in any organization that the more value you generate, the less you are paid relative to value generated. Those paid the least, who complain the most of unfair wages, are in fact the most overpaid; and those paid the most, who complain the least, the most underpaid.

The average poor’s existence is a net cost to society, they live off the extreme outperformance of their betters, their bosses they resent so much, while they waste away the hours generating 1/4 the slavewages they are paid.

Is he worth following? Seems like a grifter pedant to me

Leftists have a peculiar approach to “trolling”, it’s always exclusively cope to cover for their pathologies, so insecurely so that they rely heavily on social confirmation, publishing desperately “I’m trolling!!”, craving any comments and likes that agree: “yes this is trolling”

oh am not familiar with Kantbot’s opinions enough to follow the conversation, but he’s fat and ugly which is how I know he’s non virtuous and why I don’t follow him. My take is inner virtue expresses itself with outer beauty, but a virtueless gilded beauty can sometimes be faked

u dont stan miya anymore?

I mean, looking at only those cringe memes it’s possible theyre trolling, but you can tell they aren’t bc of how they compulsively respond to commenters, including to repeatedly claim they’re trolling. There’s a definite sense of protecting a perceived reputation or social image.

PRO TIP, HEDONISTS: Your only true self-interests are HEALTH LOVE & FAMILY.

I thought you were gone!

I hope to strip away the "rights" and "freedoms" of these "independent" slavemen so as to save them from themselves. Free them and they only build themselves new cages of incredulous self-torture. I would rather see them freed through death than alive in their hells.

Most all people claiming a "hedonistic" lifestyle only accomplish a pathological self-destruction, torturing themselves far worse than anyone who accepted impersonal responsibility within society. Girls on the cock carousel, weak boys turned hikki. Their "hedonism" is a hell.

The failure of hedonistic self-interest is in the vulnerability of individual, who fails to actually evaluate or achieve their best self-interest, plagued by high time preference and irrational judgement, and very easily manipulated into becoming the tools of parasitic memes.

Funny thing is that post could easily come from any alt lite mestizo. You’re just an anime tr*nny, im an aryan!! Really!!!

You misunderstand me. I don’t mean the close up as literal framing shot, but the frame of mind it allows, elevating the actor’s expressive capability to the forefront. When I say I wish they were handled by set designers, I mean they be treated as totems, arranged like objects.

I believe it relates to their feminized TV bred psychology that cinema is a vehicle for emotional drama, the glorified soap, evocative proxy for mundane neighborhood gossip. An empty set with two floating faces, aggressively emoting out rhetoric

Lynch is a different case, he picks his actors for their face and voice, not their acting. His close up is just framing the scene. There are no actors.

Netflix films only dominated by medium shot bc made for TV. The close-up, however, dominates their directorial psyche. Actor as a vehicle for “emotional weight”, for “expression”, close-up ideology. I wish directors be trained as set designers, and treat their actors accordingly.

I wish for the “closeup” to be banned from cinema

I see. In a sense, anon posting defeats the need for irony centrism by making everyone non-committal - no identity means no social consequences - which is why its a perfect marketplace of ideas. I get who you mean though with irony hiding pundits.

what exactly do u mean by ironyposting, ironybros, etc

lmao

Market inefficiency is only in the general public's self-interest when human capital is non-negotiable. Automation reverses this. Those who have most enjoyed wealths undeserved will feel the negative effects of this most drastically, while the rest enjoy the boon of efficiency.

You must understand if artificially prevented from solving itself, thru gov interventions such as IQ test bans, the efficient solution will soon be simply automated replacement of human capital. When real wealth is closely tied to real worth, you will feel this hit hard.

They can cope all they want, but the market continues to dig deeper, and the further money comes to organize society, the closer it will align with accurate representation of genetic stock. The discrepancy between IQ and wealth is the key representation of our inefficiency.

The same anxiety - that they may lose the chance to marry up, they may actually get what they deserve (though they claim the exact opposite) - is responsible for their fear and resentment of Capitalism: slave morality demands inefficient human organization.

They are threatened by submitted to an objective heirarchy, transparent evaluations, highly efficient human organization. It's in the collective self-interest to maintain social inefficiency in any group caught in the illusion of hypergamy.

Conceptual basis of iq is v sensible, its simply a test that directly correlates w actionable results; no a priori assumptions necessary. There's no argument against this - anyone rejecting IQ in any way is cope; their words are meaningless except to reveal what threatens them.

My most consistently controversial take has proven to be asserting personal wealth and IQ are directly correlated; it shakes people to the core because there is no way to suppress this objective, transparent tool of human valuation in the way they've achieved with IQ suppression.

I once met a man who did not have a first language, but spoke four non fluently, having traveled around between family and country as a child. He was quite the midwit, and I always wondered if this was only bc his 6th grader's language acted as a ceiling before his IQ ever did.

he kinda right doe

If you accept the "occult" cultural connotation u must accept "esoteric"'s 2. I choose to stand only by etymology, as a traditionalist, and demonstrate this by using occult as a mundane synonym for anything hidden. esoteric, on the other hand, only applies to circles or spheres.

Miya, I can't understand WTF you're talking about but,
1. i don't like it. 
2. i'm afraid.
3. it makes me angry.
4. are you a real girl?
5. are you an AI?
6. i'm smart.
7. where is the source?
8. i stan.
9. i can feel myself growing more powerful.

Lmaooo

wot u think @BreakfastClaire ur ex was a fuckboy mostly normie but sorta artsy right? Or if not artsy u wish he was right? Ur relationship w ur family is only a lil estranged not totally fucked like some of ur more reckless friends right?

It comes from tumblr, insta & to lesser extent twitter, not magazines FYI, and it’s produced by girls who were inducted into kool kid art shit by art fuckboys who memed themselves into it online to fuck these girls, who miss their fathers but didnt end up egirls but broken sluts

I’ve studied this specific egirl. My verdict is she is not of a broke enough family to warrant full art kid commitment nor hot enough to catch bf who is, thus her ex was only a normie fuck boy, so despite a tumblr bred desire for deeper aesthetics, she’s left only nominally art-y

Yeah I know its u Clarie why are u telling me That

Get the poison out of your head and convert to Vedic Hinduism, you know nothing of aryan spirituality

Abrahamics faiths are not traditional spiritualities. They’re constructed religions, algorithms designed around a core of true paganism. They can only be judged on results: like a constitution that allows for its own rejection, one that cannot sustain itself is poorly programmed. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1204091292306690048 …

lol didn’t even realize guenon converted to Islam. How are my takes straight from the gut always vindicated by titans?

Calm down and come up with a coherent set of points before spamming a bunch of reply threads and quote tweets. You have failed to address the point.

Consistently, the only argument e-Christians have against Islam are against the brown races it’s historically popular with, not the religion itself. LOL

Again, you are confusing genetics for religion. Christian Europe practiced cousin marriage widely, even at height of the canon law ban, the Catholic Church still provided dispensations; and when given the opportunity, the Protestants speedily did themselves of the restriction.

You defending modernism, not  Christianity. Arranged marriage is an old world practice, practiced by all ancient societies, noted multiple times in the Bible itself. Abraham arranged the marriage of his son. It is thoroughly eugenic, heuristic hardened by centuries of Trad use.

The Bible does not prohibit cousin marriage, it was practiced widely in Rome. Catholic church attempted prohibition on/off over the millennia, Protestant protested and their churches still often allow it. Islamic scholars have likewise discouraged it, Shafi  sect officially so.

Common misunderstanding. Incestuous dysgenics in Muslim world is a result of desert tribe dynamics, not Islam itself.

Idk I saw you make this take earlier but I’ve never really felt generation gaps with women, imo they’re either a blank or broken slate. I imagine this may be more obv with a woman with a deeper cultural education and a self-introspected personality, but I’ve only met those online

I’ve seen it oscillate between both in the same individual in/out of relationships, nympho when they’re in one but totally asexual for years when out of it, so it may somehow be two flavors of the same thing.

I don’t know the particular flavor of your autism, but fem autists in general have a distaste for sexual contact, it’s sensory overload, physical & emotional. Their healthiest partnerships are with similarly autistic men, and it does take on a character of wholesome companionship

Then I hit follow

Because you have an estranged relationship with your father.

The boys be like “anti-sex puritanism ain’t true trad, lemme fuck bro”. What do you think used goods are for if by virtue of being used they’re biologically unfit for marriage? Prostitution. There are only three kinds of women: daughters, wives & wh0res. And they know it.

You want to prevent toxic grooming by weak, abusive men? Normalize dating as test for marriage only, no physical contact until families introduced & engagement mutually agreed, no sex until marriage sealed. But they don’t want to protect young girls, only their cock carousel.

At minimum keep them out of the home. Porn should be forced back into the adult theater, let them blossom into social spaces like a modern bathhouse, to be frequented by male incels between gym night much needed comraderie even in shared debauchery.

Asked my take on the porn ban. I think all dynamic media should be banned - video, music,
all of it. Porn is bad because it’s a potent psyop vector. So are movies and videogames. Ban em. ban high speed internet, big phone screens.

Lmao

Tool/method fetishization over principle. Same thing occurs in “gear addicts”. Might be some kind of autistic misunderstanding, but I believe it traces to the same insecurity/anxiety inherent to procrastiantion which subconsciously avoids engaging the thing at a real level.

The gambit is “it’s not that I don’t appreciate art, I just don’t like Your art. See? I like This art”. All same field of isolated cope, suburban taste framed as a hypothetical brand, insecure rejection of an imagined image of urban high taste; which crumbles on first contact.

Yes, it's the most important thread.

Porn is a massive psyop campaign, but I understand your sentiment. Vidya is not medicine, all dynamic recorded media is hyper-sensitive vector for psyops, well utilized; the only real game is Dwarf Fortress, whenever it's released. Rest are true.

is this a sonic youth reference

Addendum: girls go bad due to bad/missing fathers, which they substitute w maladapted figures: a political meme-complex, a consumerist identity, maybe an addiction, or just series of (self-)abusive relationships. Force them into Islam, or with a real man, & they're suddenly cured

10. Never devalue the wife. They each have boundless love, empathy and creative energy to provide to any man that deserves it. They are the givers of life and deeply imbued with an intuitive and social intelligence that no man will ever match. 

But don't treat them as men.

9. The husband's duty is to uphold the home, bearing full responsibility for their livelihood. Wive's duty is to sublimate herself to her husband, maintain his home and raise his children. She gives her life to him; accordingly, she will not submit if he proves himself incapable.

8. A husband is to his wife as a parent is to their child. Not treated with disdain but patience, care and calm. They should never be expected to hold the same degree of responsibility and work as you; as it’s absurd to expect it from a child, it’s absurd to expect it of a wife.

7. Love is cultivated. If you treat your woman correctly, her love will blossom like a flower. If you ignore her feminine essence, do not tame her inner child, do not encourage her creativity, she will spoil and turn rotten. If you find yourself here, know it is only your fault.

6. Women have some underlying tendencies that may appear "rotten" if left unchecked, but it's essential: they’re meant to be tamed by a strong male figure. Accomplishing it proves you worthy to replace their father. Good women will not give themselves up to just anyone.

5. If you work on becoming a good man, women will come to you, without you trying. Families may introduce them to you. They will beg to bear your children, by instinct.

One aspect of being a good man is knowing good women from the bad, and raising good up to become even better.

4. Good women always have strong father figures in their lives. Good wives consider their husband to replace their father, or father figure. 

If you can't find a good woman, it's because you're not a good man.

3. The genders are equal in inherent importance, the balance of both is necessary for proper union, but they are essentially different and the gendered roles that result are essential to a functioning household and marriage. Any relationship that doesn't follow this is corrupted.

2. Understand the psychology of female attraction is in every aspect derived from the fundamental goal of finding the best mate to deliver and support the strongest offspring. This is not simply evo psych, it is still their dominating incentives, even as they reject natalism.

1. First, know women are not "bad". Society made them bad, distorting the balance between their inherent negative/positive elements. And women aren’t to blame for it, if you need someone to blame: it's you, & the men who came before you that failed to protect them. Reject cope.

0. All depictions of the fairer sex in school, news & film are wrong. False image of female psychology is the great lie the western propaganda complex has worked hardest to cultivate; you must consciously un-learn all things of modernity you've ever seen on women. Then, relearn:

Linguistically coded misogyny is praxis

It may be a shock to many of you, but it’s true that American boys really do not have any concept of the female gender and her shy obscurities. They’re induced by a propaganda of functional equality from age 5 which is usually only broken in their first sexual relationship.

Most important thing theyre hiding is nature of female psychological character, sormthing boys actually beleive is identical to their own (but no girls do). Most important thing theyre pushing is dysfunctional sexual hedonism to minimize stable marriage & subsequent reproduction.

Sex Ed teaches toxic lies - e.g. birth control is safe, abortion has no consequences, sex with a condom is same as without - while omitting essential information: female psychology is dominated by hormonal cycle, women are infertile 50% of time, orgasm induces pairbonding, etc. https://twitter.com/okaishawty/status/1202890998105309184 …

Intentionally. The trolling is getting repetitive, losing its value, and its too ephemeral, making a mess of my page’s TL when looking back for the quality posts. I have one final campaign planned before I step out, don’t have time to act on it rn.

its not negative, all drama is entertaining, but it becomes cringe when ppl take it seriously bc they didnt realize ppl were just chasing a high. no one's hypocritical, they're just all trolling for a laugh, whether it was chasing out the groomer or welcoming him back.

true morals online? dont leak dms. dont monetize. dont doxx. dont snitch to mods. dont be upset. dont spam. no cp. thats it.

chasing "groomers" "out" is 20 year old boomer self-denial. zoomers know they're all performing grooming, and are getting groomed, at every degree and level, including self-grooming, by definition in socializing online.

I didn’t know too, someone mentioned to me Hackenschmidt drank 11 pints of specifically non-homogenized milk a day. “Raw” milk is difficult to obtain in US unfortunately. Illegal in many states, have to use blackmarket farm networks.

Types imply female agency in selection, which is only the case for beta males who are the submissive in the relationship. Women are servant to their hormones, only those who can’t control that will be servant to them.

Freedom of speech is right to treason. Any state that cares about its people would ensure its own stability, and execute all subversives, degenerates, atheists; and prevent any foreigner from permanent residency--let alone, control over its finances. How far the world has fallen.

By no freedoms, I mean the state should dictate dress code, right speech, virtuous behavior, or suffer exile. By advancing citizens interests, I don't mean ban TV & internet, but raise their people such that they do not want it, only banning foreign demons which might lower them.

my ideal state is simple:
1. State & Religion one & same
2. State is sovereign
3. State's aim: (1) long-term stability; (2) advance interests of its citizens
4. Citizenship is unconditionally ethnic
5. Citizens have no freedoms except in service to the State

Bhutan is the ideal. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1202699811658428416 …

FUD perpetuated by female corvid "researchers". Murders of crows have territory wars, but that's an entirely separate phenomenon from the distinct crow court. The farmers know.

Crows hold court. They sometimes gather in a tribunal against one of their own, debate their sentence, and either let them go or perform an execution.

Many avenues of automated capitalism greatly handicapped by our obstinate copyright laws, and they only hurt the consumer, in protection of “artist” ego more than income. They must be taken down.

lol

Rabbits are for eating

The only reason these “””artists””” care their “””art””” was “””stolen””” is because they think maybe they could’ve gotten some of that money themselves. They’re just little Disney, and should be treated with equal disdain.

It's an obstinate analog stand against enroaching automation of art, an artificial recreation of the historical "organic" experience. Soon this will be the only humanity we have left, but I would like they drop the pretense and all be cover bands for the sake of efficiency.

All funny jokes are funny because they contain kernels of truth. Godspeed

The boundaries one must set are media blackout and friendship ban, for the female-degenerative propaganda is pervasive. The only alternative is strong and regular dicking, to refresh her mind. This is the truth.

i shall take this into consideration, my friend

Agreed, have made this point before. The capital T 
"Tradition" is not the same as the lower t 'trad'. trads referencing evola, revolt against the modern world, reject modernity, etc. are doing the same diluted co-option as wignats using "acceleration". https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1197204691282587653?s=20 …

Infanticide was common in pre-Christian civilization, in East as well - China, Japan, India -  though some, such as the Greeks, preferred exposure over execution, leaving the newborn’s survival up to the Gods. It was abhorred only with Islam and, to a lesser extent, Christendom.

The correct answer is, btw, abortion is bad because it’s a satanic ritual & its underhanded normalization seeks to position hedonistic self-interest as the ultimate morality, all in program of miscegenating the Aryan race. Not same thing as infanticide nor the same context.

It’s effective rhetoric, though, because renegotiating their understanding of tradition is his ultimate goal.

Amazing that they just went ahead and leaked the public’s first speech generation tool and they managed to shut it down over copyright infringement and memory hole it in a week with not a single coder trying to reproduce it or anyone caring.

Better to have 9 strong kids who will enter legend and marry well + 3 who didn’t make it, then 2-3 carefully raised losers who’ll go vegan and/or gamer at 18.

Higher emotional sensitivity is very important for childrearing, as well as the empathy that comes with it. Female emotion also ties directly with the hormonal fertility cycle, your body basically manipulates you into being impregnated.

Your children will be much better off if your care ended at food & bed: let their education be delivered by elder family, their play dangerous in the street, their discipline learned by trial, and in work, and their exposure to mass culture wait until they final leave the home.

LA is the only city left in the world. NYC, Paris, Tokyo exist only as ghosts of times past; self-mythologizing has ended, they persist only in the nostalgia of tourists who dream of visiting. Yet LA transcends itself every day, mythopoetics only accelerating with their deaths.

"I love L.A." and "this city is killing me" (popularly known as "I feel like I'm being eaten alive") mean the same thing.

 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcADqxnQA_4 …

LA parallels digitality: in its cultural acceleration as the epicenter of global culture, the spearhead of modernity, the fount of all new trends; in being host to the multitude, more microcosms alone than the rest of the real. the future spirals out from its orbit.

Grind it into a fine powder, e.g. with a coffee grinder or blender. Some people pour it into their own pill capsules, but you can just mix in water. You can also just fuck it and eat the eggshell whole. Try it.

There are rumors the whites hold anti-nutrients and are best ditched altogether. However, the eggshell is a great source of calcium - grind it and mix into drink.

Not a meme. Raw eggs only proper way to eat em. You can chug them cold Rocky style, but I recommend having them in beer, 1-2 per pint, whisked. Egg dropped into fresh bowl of rice and mixed (tamago gohan), with some salt, pepper and cayenne, is based too. https://twitter.com/anewdarkage/status/1202074592228986880?s=20 …

Silver age

Change my mind about what?

wait does this make sense. I mean that it only passes down through males.

What evolist's bit fails to recognize is wokeness is patrilineal.

The microgeneration who got their start on 2004-2007 4chan are the hyperboreans of the internet: that culture and stock representing the most powerful, the most true, the purest expression of the heart of the Wired. All web culture to follow is a degeneration of that peak.

At the very minimum, organize, archive and compile them. I want to read them.

Looking forward to it

As chan diaspora, I wandered here seeking novelty, and was thus introduced to BAM. I immediately recognized it for what it was. I sent it to Sunny, who immediately recognized it for what it was. There are few here who do, you know who you are, and I implore you all to PUBLISH!

Bronze Age Mindset was first time 4chan's esoteric tradition put to print. Anyone from same background cud recognize most all it discussed, yet to anyone else, its knowledge was from beyond. This exotericization must be continued, and not in tweets & posts, but onto PDF, & print.

I'm trying to get a read on you, because your psychology as a woman is abnormal. I don't believe you have an estranged relationship with your father, but you probably are somewhat socially autistic, higher than average IQ and some kind of deep-seated sexual aversions. Hot or cold

Are you sexually active, Kate?

Should pay closer attention to my feed

Au contraire, I love women and women love me.

In any public forum, women are the outgroup.

I do

What’s the contradiction, Kate

Disagree. One should keep reiterating it to refine it, and also there’s value in it coming from your own hand, captured into your own context. It’s more powerful for me to repeat an idea than to retweet it.

1. That’s cope, theyre attacked because they’re inauthentic attention seekers

Bullying out co-opters chasing the money/attention, claiming to speak for the movement while neutering its views into something safely manageable is proper use of gatekeeping. They must submit or shut up.

One thing I was wondering, does sodomite as it was understood in biblical times literally referred to anal sex, or is that a modern interpretation?

Obviously I mean online. Hazing irl is important as well, but within your direct friend circle, as all male circles naturally tend towards. Banter is a group exercise that trains social wit and emotional stoicness, leaving a soft friend out only keeps him weak.

Maybe bc you’re getting cucked at scale, and no women, and none of your ancestors, hold an ounce of respect for u?

If you don’t haze cringe, you open the door to cancer, co-option and feds. Unconditional kindness is suicidal.

No, I meant discrete, as in, treated as separate.

One must understand there are many forms of bodybuilding, many sculpts as of yet unexplored. Many paths, if pursued in full, with earnesty, on the right man, all reach the end-point: Beauty. Bodybuilding includes all from the tankish powermaxxer to the slender, mewing aristocrat. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1202084560965689344 …

Aesthetics is only goal; strength training is aesthetical too - it assumes beauty is in body's natural expression of strength. Many paths to Beauty, all only approximate  inherent ideal; 1 must do what's best for 1self. Remember: bodybuilder has many forms, many yet undiscovered.

slave mentality

Goes well with lager and pilsners. It's a good breakfast drink: protein & carbs. Gold miners in the American West used to drink it before starting day.

I believe it is only difficult to see in people who are complicit in committing the same pathological acts; their subconscious hides it from themselves to protect their ego from realizing their own actions. When you don't hide reality from yourself, it shouts out to you.

Also, try it in beer. Crack two eggs into a pint and mix well with spoon. You’ll be surprised, it’s tasty.

Specifically, salmonella is nonexistent in quality eggs, that is, pasture raised, as it’s a product of dirty farm conditions. Still minimal in generic - there were outbreaks in 90s that put the fear in people. Buy quality eggs anyway though, they’re more nutritious.

You aren’t familiar with all the stuff the bodybuilder bro’s do to maximize test/minimize xenoestrogens? Sunbathing, nofap, chewing gum, power poses; natural soaps, no receipt touching, etc.

One might think I hate the natives for advocating their genocide, but i do so because I love them, and so I wish to put them out of their misery. Their entire people have been reduced to a great charade, there is no worse fate.

I'm speaking to a male audience.

Because broken girls with father issues manifest a female oedipal complex, their need for a father figure fetishized into a sexual obsession. Attraction to a king or equivalent is natural and healthy, precluding fetishization (which demands taboo).

There are off-site tools you can use to track unfollows. Imo, twitter should notify you by default. It's useful to track how much damage you've done trolling. Subtweet is when someone posts about you but doesn't @ you so you don't get notified.

#3 Online Ascension https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1201965625423228928?s=20 …

Have worded it exactly that way: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1164033936906829826?s=20 …

Summing up the thread:
1. Ignore the social
2. Treat all posts discreetly
3. Treat yourself sovereign
4. Value only lulz and self-improvement

Practice these Four Values & you will find yourself free of burden, ascended over the network, and mog relentlessly all who confront you.

18. If anyone's actions online reflect a goal of anything other than (1) lulz, (2) self-improvement; they're toxic.

17. On the lower end, social friendships online amount to mutual dopamine masturbation and, in DM's, an attention-filler for their IRL loneliness, emotional vampirism, either one-way or oscillating between both equally pathetic parties. There is nothing for you here.

Read @BPD_GOD on twitter dot com.

16. Purely social friendships people make online are all feedback loops of increasing manipulation. The ultimate end of this is the online relationship, nothing more than mutual blackmail into interdependency thru progressively shred vulnerability at best. Nothing for you here.

15. All social expression online is performed. For many it is subconscious, for the best it is conscious, but for all it is a performance, ESPECIALLY WOMEN. Don't fall for it! They're not depressed, anxious, having breakdown, in tears. They're manipulating for attention. PERIOD.

14. There is no good reason to ever discuss doxxable IRL info online, including with your friends, except to spread disinfo. Never. The only value providing your date of birth, city, college, face, etc. has ever been is in doxxing. Vulnerability will not solve your loneliness.

13. Socialization always toxic online, but friendship is not.  Friendship is direct, one on one: brotherly loyalty, noiseless communication, intellectual discussion, freewheeling banter. Masculine opposite of socialization's group manipulations. Those are "friends", not friends.

12. The only beef that's truly won is the beef that ends in friendship

11. Do not consider even your own public image, your "brand". Don't think you're beholden to any requirement of consistency, of sincerity. The only thing you must strive for is quality content, that is: good lulz or good knowledge exposition. Nothing else matters. Nothing!

10. I can't stress this enough: if you care about random people online, remember their names and faces and dramas, contextualize all their posts you see in that frame, act and respond in reflection of that knowledge, you lose. pic.twitter.com/fZdu4iOVL1

9. Be neutral! Someone is annoying twat, but he posted dank? Like & RT all the same! Likewise, don't peter out undeserved likes to friends just bc theyre friends; are they worthy friend if they can't earn likes rightfully? Are you good friend if you enable their weak posting? NO!

wtf is geohell

8. Your word must be sovereign: never self-censor for fear of social consequence. Only excuse for self-censorship is (1) avoid a ban, or (2) trolling. If you do it because you worry you might hurt someone's feelings, someone might think less of you, you're only trolling yourself!

7. Lighten up, and care not if people refuse to. There is no reason to ever be upset online and no reason to care if someone is: their feelings are a problem, and this problem will only ever be solved if you train their emotional tolerance. Friends don't enable friends' weakness!

6. Look at posts, not people. Let each post stand on its own merit. The author is negligible-- there is no way to assure his sincerity, there is no reason to want to. Assume everything anyone says is a Devil's Advocate: remember, you're here for lulz & elucidation, nothing else!

5. Don't hold beefs, don't hold biases. Pick fight with someone today? Treat him same as anyone else tomorrow. One should forget every interaction the moment it concludes, and treat every new interaction entirely afresh. How much rental space is cleared in your mind!

4. I advise you do opposite of the social-obsessives: ignore  social entirely. Pay NO attention to friendships & circles of people in your network. Ignore entirely their various cliques, their politics & dramas. How liberated you will feel: it is not ignorance, but transcendence.

3. Oh, wait, you're here because you're lonely? Throw out your computer, you have no business here! These who crave socialization are the cancer who have poisoned the network with their maladapted pathology, those who are so desperately invested in their e-reputation. I spit.

2. Why are we here? Only two true answers, ideally you follow both: (1) the lulz, and (2) self-improvement. Never forget this. The social games are for fun, they're for banter and keks. They are not serious business! The only time for srs business is learning time. Never forget.

1. Online socialization on non-anonymous communities has become deeply feminized. Men succumb to embarrassingly petty drama, get burned at slightest slight and nurse the grudge for months, hide behind passive aggression and behind-the-back shadiness. This is not you, reject this!

What part of "assume all DM's are recorded" do you not understand? I posted that in my GC, you think I don't know exactly what I was doing?

add me

That wasn’t a real beef, I was just making a case study for the troll thread. Fakes are top bantz but I don’t respect anyone who post real DMs. One should always assume all DMs are recorded and shared; it follows that you shouldn’t say anything in DMs you wouldn’t say publicly.

Anything that needs to be dm’d is something you shouldn’t be doing. Doxxing anyone except the enemy is ultimate cowardice

Clout is a shield, giving pretense to avoid engaging with criticism from anyone with less clout than you, and this cowardice is availed endlessly. All call-outs and beefs of clout accounts should be signal boosted as praxis, regardless if you agree or not. It keeps em sharp.

One shouldn’t consider political opinions relevant to friendship.

That’s a good way of putting it:  Grind luck, not money.

When did you break mutual?

no u must @ or QT me. It is tribute

no subtweeting

Often people post under my takes random “thinkers” who’ve said similar. Know I reference no one, nothing is drawn from reading. My takes manifest spontaneously, handmaiden of the collective intelligence.

The takeaway should not be that they achieved wealth by luck, but that wealth comes nonlinearly; it is not grinded over time. The goal of financial wellness is to maximize windfall chances and prepare yourself to best leverage them.

Believing all luck is dumb luck is cope. You can’t force any event to occur, but you can position yourself to maximize their chances of occurring, and maximize their leverage. Smart luck, if you will.

What they don’t tell you is “luck” can be trained. https://twitter.com/jcbonthedl/status/1201903704837959682 …

No one said anything about it not being a luxury, or green, or nonmodern. that’s why OP’s text is nonsensically applied. the only relevance is that it also discusses anti-family. I only wish to point out the inanity of OP’s post, bc midwittery annoys me, not debate acc praxis.

Yeah. That’s ur two brain cells. lole

It does not. His point is that the extended family/village-as-family is actual trad arrangement; nuclear family is a modern invention falsely chased because we’ve fallen even further. And that the best way to return is by acceleration. This has nothing to do with OP’s text.

Boldfaced lie. where’s your evidence

This dunk is dumb. There have been may angles of crit theory targeting the dismantling of the family, that you’ve read only one doesn’t mean it applies. You could’ve just called him patriarchy.

I see. I believe the breaking point is only AI. Anything tech until then is still existentially contingent on general civilizational stability; digitality ends if the first world does, but AI will harden its persistence beyond human life near-immediately, and expand the universe.

Goal is to mate with the highest quality genetics you can obtain, to produce children who will in turn reproduce with best possible genes. Not being good enough to obtain a high quality mate isn’t grounds for suiciding your lineage.

It’s unsustainability taken you it’s conclusion demonstrates the destructiveness of the meme you and many others have internalized. “Better to never reproduce then reproduce badly” is anti-natalism, qualitively the same, only less extreme than “better to have never been born”.

It is ending with a more extreme dysgenics than anything you could ever produce: sterility. They’re in tears.

Self-destructive meme. You fail to continue your lineage, you have failed at your one duty in life. Your ancestors are weeping while you cope. https://twitter.com/SinningCrow/status/1201534996529500167 …

The problem is cuck men are marrying and raising children with non-virgin women. They should only be considered fit for prostitutes or concubines.

It’s Wikipedia knowledge. Jüngling is mentioned in the page for “Virgin”, and the Jüngling page mentions “Until the 19th century, the youth was the male equivalent of the non-sexually active youth, a virgin young man.” Uncited. There is likely much subtlety lost

why is it the people who tell you to chill out always the ones taking things seriously

You mean low time preference, but yes

What poors fail to understand is a critique of slave morality does not seek to preclude them from nobility, but to save them from their false nobility. Returning the Master as a role model is for the benefit of the slave: so that he may learn to be masterly, he may learn virtue. https://twitter.com/kingk0ld/status/1201215239410405378 …

Long-term robustness

Poverty has never been a question of money. A lack of funds is only a result, not the condition itself. No windfall can save the poor from their poverty, just as no financial crisis can ever impoverish the wealthy. Think about it.

The point is rather than spend $20 on 20 shitty tools, spend $20 on 1-2 good ones. He’s right. A class war is occurring in the replies because poorbrain syndrome precludes valuing lindyness.

E-celebs shouldn’t be hated and chased out only for being carpetbagging snakes, but also because they provide the space for federal agents to proliferate, because even if they aren’t already compromised with dirt over their heads, they act like it, in all their grift.

Anyone who tells you anything other than never facedoxx, never monetize, never meetup irl, and never trust anyone that does, is fedposting. Fedposting isn’t calls to violence, its not “radicalization”. It’s deanonymization and psyop distortions towards that. Learn the difference. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1201017626182311936 …

Can’t say now, but their time will come. There are feds and fed informants on this network; they maintain clout despite it being known by their peers. You should assume all facedoxxers and/or e-celebs are compromised; trust no one who trusts them.

Also lol @ grifterism’s ego conditioning them to actually believe that signal boosting FUD is neutered (for anyone it was meant for) just by poo-pooing it in a quote tweet.

“An e-celeb optics grifter pentests various angles before settling on a meme co-option, artificially signal-boosted by fellow carpetbaggers & other known feds, but he’s absolved of suspicion by same affected pseudo- martyrdom, rebellion, persecution of every other conservacuck.” https://twitter.com/ScottMGreer/status/1200941458565554177 …

He’s not wrong. Freedom is a burden to the peasant caste.

You are again missing the point: exclusivity. Most people in higher education today do not belong there. SAT is just a poorly designed IQ test with a stupidly low ceiling. The admissions process needs to be strictly regulated at a high standard to maintain exclusivity.

University should be gatekept, you have missed that point to fixate on your trigger. Means of exclusivity unimportant; IQ could be substituted on grounds of height or nepotism without losing the content. Deprogram yourself & address your insecurities before approaching me again.

The mythopoetically potentiated scenario is most likely the true one, you already know this Anya. Nick is not what he appears to be, anyone can see this much. Choosing what portrait you decide to paint behind his black beady eyes is the only project.

We will siege and starve university as we will siege and starve the ghetto. A fresh start. The entry to schooling is 130 IQ STEM, 145 humanities.

Poverty is synonymous with parasitism. They’ll whine endlessly with unfounded entitlement, pathetic bitterness, about any hand that feeds them, any who permit their less than worthless existences, all because they who bring the world wealth enjoy more of it than those who do not.

Mental exercise for the slave moralogues: estimate net value contribution to society versus net cost to society anyone talking at you. Most are net negative. Why permit their existence? Why allow them on same roads as me? Allow them to share with me twitter dot com? Slave world

Ghettos should be sieged and starved, the homeless chased out of the cities and into the woods by stick and fire. All welfare should come with the stipulation of sterilization, and trade school replace highschool if an entry IQ exam is not passed. It’s all so drearily easy.

Idr which I use. Can you whip up mocks for both?

Can’t install your own? Helvetica and Arial are nearly the same anyway, difference is only that Arial has slightly rounded endings, while Helvetica is perfectly straight.

Typeface design is very intuitive. Just toy around until you find something that feels right. One trick is to take a few steps back and see if it is still generally legible. I think you’ve already achieved that PBS feeling though.

Oh just answered this under another comment. Arial and Helvetica are standards. I’ve tried researching what typeface was standard in 50-70s optical period but I think it was all proprietary, but basically looks like Arial/Helvetica.

Looks like Arial, looks fine. Try Alte Haas Grotesk. It’s a close match to Criterion’s subtitles, has a more old school look.

Looks good borzoi, and I don’t say that lightly. Monologuing media is my taste. One note, subtitle legibility benefits from shorter clauses; though this damages “screencappability”. A solid introduction to subtitling (can ignore kerning section): https://www.md-subs.com/saa-subtitle-font …

Look, if you've reached your mid 20s and haven't had multiple virgin women from stable households seek you out, pledge their love to you, request in no uncertain terms to marry you & have your children...you have to consider that maybe you aren't actual worthy of a virgin bride.

Just need to aim higher. True bougie girls, not petite bougie, lend themselves very well to housewifery; a good home demands delicate taste. Train them to be where they need to be; as long as they’re virgin you can’t go wrong.

I recommend finishing once every 3-6 times for any consistent partner. They do need your jing as well to truly blossom as your partner, be it as wife or concubine.

Still commonplace in both rural, white, churchgoing towns; as well as the international jetset crowd. Only the overblown, slavebrain middle class has been left out.

Many such cases

This comes up often. The fact is, if you have trouble finding a good woman, it's because you're not a good man. If you were, good fathers would be reaching out to line up their good daughters for you. Work on yourself, women will follow.

Impregnation through precum is a myth; just pull out during fertility window, finish inside during menstruation period. Sinple. 

Also, make sure to finish down her throat, or at least on her face, so as not to waste the benefits of your jing.

So what? Grooming is traditional: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1198717290730012672?s=20 …

How, then, to have a healthy relationship in modernity? It's sinple really:
1. Have unprotected sex often, make her finish at least once every time.
2. Do not date any woman who is a non-virgin—that includes masturbation.
3. Don't be circumcised.

18. They've done much to hide this from the youth. Not taught in sex ed, and obtusely named "Fertility Awareness Method". A nonsensical term: all women know intimately their own cycle, and any man that doesn't know his partner's? Doesn't know his partner. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1162801447878062080?s=20 …

17. Finishing inside has a very deep effect, one not well understood but evidenced in spades. The hormonal energy of your sperm absorbs into her body and instills a well-being and youthfulness; your DNA microchimerizes to combine with her, her mind becomes sublimated into yours.

16. A final note, much work has been done to obscure the fact you may finish inside a woman without reproductive consequence during week of her period. A myth has even been perpetuated there is still chance of pregnancy. Impossible: if she's bleeding, her uterus lining is shed.

15. Birth control is final element of broken relationships. It tricks the body into thinking your pregnant, causing many endocrine disruptions but most important is female pheromonal attraction changes during pregnancy: going on/off the pill causes breakups & cheating, every time pic.twitter.com/ytOxuj3PW3

14. Truly, for a man, sex with a condom is not sex at all. Men who have never fornicated without "protection" may still be considered virgins.

13. Without fluid transfer, man produces limited oxytocin, bonding weakly to his partner. When you use a condom, you block all fluid transfer. This is the third major element damaging modern sexuality after male circumcision and female masturbation.

12. Sexual fluid transfer is most important for the man. Woman's vaginal secretions, largely prolactin, received by the man induces  testosterone production, increases male fertility, and oxytocin in himself. Precum, in return, nourishes the womb and induces prolactin production.

11. Ultimately, circumcised men resort to lubricant. This brings me to my next point: fluid transfer. The use of lubricant greatly dilutes the essential sexual fluid transfer that occurs in intercourse, in a feedback loop of increasing virility and fertility signals.

10. Both dulling factors not only limit male pleasure, forcing him towards crude roughness, but also cause inability to intimately sense physical dimensions of the female body, insensitivity to contractions & tensing which communicate pleasure points. Both are left unpleasured.

9. Circumcision removes 50% of the gland's nerve endings, greatly damaging the man's ability to feel both pleasure and sensitivity to the physical dimensions of female body. Further, it exposes the head of the penis: what should be soft is roughened through repeated abrasions. pic.twitter.com/NdD6l1wgE5

8. As female masturbation is the great bane of modern women, circumcision is the great bane of modern man. They hate to hear it, but circumcision makes men suffer much greater difficulty in pleasuring a woman to orgasm. pic.twitter.com/oc5fAWxb0y

7. A relationship without female orgasm is a failed relationship. Man's goal in sex is always her orgasm, the oxytocin it produces results in immediate & obvious love, bonding & servility: it instills wifeliness. This secret has been lost to modern coomer. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1199108028013801472?s=20 …

6. The blame is often on male masturbation, and the psychological effects of porn & the dulling of sexual pleasure. This is bad and worth cutting, but ultimately a distraction. More important is it teaches men to think of sex as masturbation, an act purely aimed at ejaculation.

5. Overmasturbatory men might have noted similar: that women cannot pleasure them as efficiently as they pleasure themselves, and a dulling of their sensation from their aggressive masturbation. But masturbation is far insidious in women, remolding their sensitive psyches totally

4. Female masturbation is intensive, & usually targets specifically the clitoris. This dulls clitoral sensitivity, making it harder for the man to pleasure her, and produces a self-fetishization which targets the specifically efficient attraction point over a holistic experience.

3. A novel, unspoken epidemic of modernity is that of female masturbation. Women subject themselves to psychic distortion by orgasming to, and thus inducing bonding with, virtualities: porn, their imaginations, themselves. It damagers natural attraction. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1199093693459783680?s=20 …

2. Oxytocin is the hormone to know. It's produced when you cuddle, when you stare into each other's eyes. It produces the feeling of love, of a fuzzy stomach, a longing heart.

1. Two key aspects to make sex solidify a relationship, and both are greatly hampered today: the female orgasm, and the exchange of sexual fluid. We'll start with the former: many women report never experiencing orgasm with a partner, only through masturbation. This is a crisis. pic.twitter.com/TxmFBKzazQ

What you have are trolls trolling trolls, endlessly. This was a common back on the days of the imageboards: everyone holds a presumption of insincerity, but feigns assumption of sincerity for the sake of simulating argument, ia mock satire of the genuine dramas of lesser sites.

Amplify and accelerate is almost always the memetically potentiated response. Why would he respond in any other way? except if he were to actually an L and eject from e-celebrity. Of course, this goes both ways; amplifying his troll by presuming it’s sincere is also the move.

Imagine falling for this bait just because pretending a fake L is real helps you cope with a fake W. Onision is one of the most ancient youtube e-celebs, he’s been making a clickbait performance of his life for the entirety of web 2.0’s existence.

I think parsiverse sounds like iranocentrism, and reference to “multiverse” in the context of neologism etymology is ironic considering the coinage mistakes “verse” for “universe”; they meant to say “multi-universe”. I only appreciate this kind of fumbling done with wit, on slang

problem is midwits can't unpack the text, so think it's just randomly generated big words. they see its popular, laugh along with the crowd while not understanding why it's funny/evocative, so fail to replicate. evidenced by them overdesigning the tryhard visuals, every time

Pic related. Be advised, cost of nocturnal emission is worth 100 cooms. pic.twitter.com/aoZ3QuACCx

Qigong

21. In celibacy you would redirect your sexual energy to a procedure of meditation, or prayer. If you continue to experience morning wood or nocturnal emissions, you are still lustful. You are not celibate. If you are tortured by the temptation of women, you are not celibate.

20. If you cannot cultivate full sexual energy through sex multiple times daily, ideally with multiple partners, a path of celibacy might be recommendable. Contrary to popular belief, celibacy is not simply restraint from sex, or from masturbation but restraint from sexuality.

19. Coolidge Effect, that is, the tendency to get bored of a single partner and seek new ones, is sometimes discussed as a negative side effect accelerated by porn. This is true, but only a problem for women and monogamous societies.

"The master's sexual battle is to give a woman an orgasm while avoiding ejaculation, his enemy is woman… he should keep himself under control, his mind as detached as if it were floating in the azure sky, his body sunk into nothingness." True Manual of the Perfected Equalization

17. Be advised, women feed off your cum. As it makes you more powerful, it makes them more powerful. You must preserve it and only deliver it unto them when deserved (1 out of every 3 sex)

lol

16. Be advised, snakes have spread a myth about nofap producing prostate cancer. Pay it no heed. pic.twitter.com/mW6o8KFjrm

15. Semen retention is safe and valid, and will result in the reabsorption of the hormonal and nutritional and spiritual energy of your sperm into the body. You will feel refreshed and energetic, a far cry from the depletion experienced by coomers.

Semen retention technique: 
1. Tightly press left index and thumb to base of penis
2. Pinch the tip closed with right hand
3. Hold breath until climax completes
4. Simultaneously clench the anus
5. Roll eyes upward as if to view the brain
6. Follow climax with extended exhalation

have you ever considered you might be poor and bezos is not because you are dumb and bezos is not https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1198875175929827329?s=20 …

13. I will unveil the occulted: semen retention does not refer to simply not cumming. It is a technique of ejaculating without release, thus redirecting the cum backwards, internally. Where does it go? Up the spine and into the head. Your sexual energy becomes spiritual power. pic.twitter.com/gYmcu1lTc9

If you're having sex 3 times a day, your cum schedule accelerates. A cycle that takes 7 days for an incel takes 12 hours for someone sexually active. Note: if you're not fucking 3 times a day, you're not really sexually active.

12. For incels, this program can still be maintained by edging. You must cultivate immense sexual energy, gather it up such that it overflows. Not simply restraint, but lust embraced and gathered to the limit. And yet, we are only halfway there. pic.twitter.com/yyUwfLpjeQ

11. To have sex and not ejaculate, however, leads to great power. The sexual energy cultivated is not released, but internalized. This is the real secret of nofap: nocum. If you want real T gains, cum no more than once a day, and fuck no less than 3 times a day. Thank me later.

10. Ejaculation weakens the male spirit. Yet sex is good for it. Sex with a woman is a great hormonal exchange (be advised: one much diminished by the condom), which produces great sexual energy gains. Ejaculation here is sustainable; ejaculation in solitaire is not.

9. Female masturbation is far more insidious than male masturbation, BTW. Their orgasm produces massive dose of oxytocin, chemical of bonding & love. Great in sex and why you find pleasuring women always turns them doteful. Yet when they schlick to porn, what are they bonding to?

8. Must be noted, fetishes are also instilled in depth by trauma. Our desire-complexes are habitual, neural connections that solidify by use over time, like a meandering goat trail turned into roman roads. While any can be reversed, they are self-reinforcing and can dig very deep

7. Fetishes are stark example of rewired desire-complexes produced by compulsive porn consumption, prohibiting natural sexual pleasure. Any fetish (including homosexuality) can be cured by extended abstinence. Nofappers call it porn reboot, daoists called it Virgin Boy Training. pic.twitter.com/ui2fO2ttP1

6. There very likely is a concerted effort to diminish the virility of men through porn. The unprecedented mass availability of porn is destructive in normalizing unnaturally excessive ejaculation, but also in its insidious psychological damage. Porn should never be consumed. pic.twitter.com/IadHr5WtFy

5. Testosterone's importance to healthy masculine expression is well-known; it's the basic precondition to power & influence. The second important element is the many zinc in cum, which effects energy levels and the beauty of your skin, hair. Both highly deficient in modern males pic.twitter.com/iEfQt4Y1uI

4. The immediate physical gains of nofap derive from testosterone. The T gains of no fap (and subsequent lift gains) are well known to the experimental bodybuilder sphere. The schedule peaks at Day 7 at about 1.5-2X gains. Do note: this sets a new baseline and stacks indefinitely pic.twitter.com/6i99A9lfIv

3. Cum is one of Daoist's 3 essential life-energies to be treasured, preserved and cultivated; they believed you only have so many ejaculations in your life before you die. Excessive cooming was considered to result in premature aging and fatigue. Sound familiar? pic.twitter.com/TqK2Kyu7vF

2. It is only abstinence of ejaculation, and abstinence of lust, which will lead you towards immortality. Your sexual energy must either be cultivated and internalized, or entirely redirected entirely away in a true celibacy. Simple restraint from acting on lust is not enough.

1. Nofap's broscience has partially converged on many truths known to eternal tradition, great precedence in power gains of sexual meditation. However, it misses two key aspects the ancients knew: semen retention, and SEX!

Must note #nofap is umbrella to Four Abstinences:
1. Abstinence of ejaculation: sexually active, but not to release
2. Abstinence of masturbation: sexually active, but only with partner
3. Abstinence of sex: sexually inactive, but lustful
4. Abstinence of lust: no sexual desire

Castration is a valid form of sexual therapy. I didn’t say they should be excluded from anything, I suggested you wouldn’t be so quick to include pedophiles with the same degree of open acceptance and dismissal of their sins, despite their equivalency.

How does this contradict my statement that sodomites should be saved, not condoned? Sinners and blasphemers are not your allies. Christ’s love is to not give up on them on their potential to be good, that doesn’t make them acceptable as they are.

My position is clear. Gays reproduce through pedophilia and the asshole is a portal to satan. Any answer besides therapy, castration and/or execution is degenerate to society.

They’ve always been the people of satan, and have always known sodomy is his portal. These judeo-christos invite satan into their ranks to virtual signal satanic misinterpretation of christly love, one which tolerates sin, rather than only pitying it.

I think sodomy is on par with raping a child, yes, and usually in conjunction with it. Sodomites are to be saved, or castrated, not condoned.

You wouldn’t say the same about pedophilia, and yet

Finesse to hide that you’re stealing. Why hide it though?

If your content is contingent on audience approval, you’re easily replaceable.

There’s game theory to community collectively agreeing to social contract of “respecting authorship”: artificially limiting efficient organization of virality allows spillover clout to trickle down. Tweetdecking disrupts this; small acct resentment reveals their clout aspirations

Why is stealing tweets bad though?

Let it rot. I wish to see all discreet identities destroyed. All content should be decontextualized from its “authors”. If it can’t withstand a coherency without the name stamp, it was a weak brand anyway: steal my tweets, it only makes me more powerful.

Stealing tweets is anti-authorship praxis, a noble content-liberation function in the same vein as piracy and plagiarism (based). Rather than irreverent stealing, it’s those burned by their supposed lack of “credit” that reveal a grifter mindset - it’s a You problem.

All modern technology is only ever either destructive, or repairing the damage of destructive technology—most often both. Not one technology yet has been “invented” that improves the station of man without any.

All tech “advancements” attributed to science are actually earned only by engineering. Medical industry has only ever killed; urban disease was eliminated thru civil eng’s hygiene. Computer tech, water systems, architecture, all of engineers with no debt to science’s “knowledge”.

Sculpting is a noble medium, when formed up by clay or carved out of stone. However, like all technical arts, you will only produce profanities unless you apprentice under a master. Work hard & own land outside the city, a good house, the home will follow. Ignore politics always.

Today the same program remains, a tentative alliance between the few and true neopagans, and the many christcucks; any line drawn pointing out the incompatibility in pursuit of Truth is met with cries of FUD and disruption: "no brother fighting when the enemy is at the gates!"

Christianity was the lame dog of fascism, only reluctantly given strategic lip service, not as an ally, but just enemy of thy enemy, a stopgap against the even worse post-christian nihilism it wrought. All of Europe, beginning with Rome, traces its unraveling to that one point.

Miscegenation is the great crisis of the kali yuga, destroyer of all virtue, of all knowledge, of all strength. The caste schedule was the dam that protects edenic humanity from ignobility; demolished, we are drowning in a long flood. Blood is our god, its muddying your chains.

Program of Traditionalism is hyperborean spiritual reconstructivism, period. They cry disruptor for revealing this: christian alliance is strategic as stopgap against modernity's post-christian nihilism; Thule Society forced into same charade. But I speak for truth, not politics.

There is no possible Christian Traditionalism; that theseus' ship theology was unstable from day 3. The only question re: christianity and Traditionalism is if christianity is root of modernism, as Nietzsche suggested, or just another facet of it, of the eternal Sumerian perhaps.

Speaking nothing of veracity of their saints; Abrahamism seeks sort of artificial permanence, constructed traditionalism, designed as memetic algorithm measured by propagation.

A return to tradition means a return to eternity, of infinite cyclical stability. The desert faiths are resolutely modern, non-infinite, directional, rejection of eternal civilization. The only traditionalism present within the christian sects are in their accreted roman paganism

Tradition is cyclical eternity, nothing less. Modernity is unidirectional time: unshackled in irreversible feedback loop towards eventual zero-state equilibrium. Any "return" on this timeline—be it 25, 150 or 2000 yrs ago—is not a return to tradition, but to X yrs old modernism. pic.twitter.com/dgca6UhT16

Slave man modernity is largely a product of a massive, engineered epidemic of early childhood trauma on every level from physical, emotional, spiritual and nutritional. You must actively resist this when childrearing, and the first step is blood solidarity.

One thing I rarely see advised: if you must leave children to be cared for by non-family, ensure they are at least of same ethnic clade, or your caretaker WILL lack basic empathy for the child and WILL treat them abusively. This rule holds for unsupervised schooling or tutelage. https://twitter.com/HarmlessYardDog/status/1195378270600081408 …

When you're the strong horse, circles always naturally gravitate to your orbit, an ambient exposure alone enough to gather the following grifters expend hours cultivating. A following of higher quality, whom only the weakest of which would fell to cancellation's social extortion.

Exist instead as an independent, psuedonymous entity, dismiss with irreverence the many connections of the social rhizome, act on own gut principle alone, and you mog, invulnerable: Block me and you only lose access to my golden content. What do I lose in return? Nothing at all.

Cancellation only works if your primary value is derived from social networking. There exist many social grifters who say nothing of worth, demonstrate no virtue, but achieve status in hierarchy by pathologically cultivating relationships. These are only ones cancel-vulnerable.

An AI coordinator organizing society based on predictive genetic determinism is technology's end-return, a robotic limb serving to replace deterministic, sub-ethnic orderliness. The repair of what was lost in modernity is the only achievement any of our technology can hope for.

Accordingly, ancient society was easily and reliably organized by caste and clade. Millennia of blood muddling has taken this away from all but the most isolated tribes, resulting in a self-reinforcing degeneration - yet thru technological acceleration, may be in our hands again.

The golden ages, dating before runaway miscegenation, enjoyed a fully transparent physiognomy whose predictive heuristics were casually accessible to anyone taking a moment to look at their fellowman, where one glance tells with high confidence their character and background.

I used to believe that even the most godless heathen could be turned to th true way if only he had opportunity to experience real sexual sublimation, ancient infinite union between man & woman. Now I understand that experience will never come precisely because of his godlessness.

Those who wield incel as an insult, measure social status on sexual access, commit the same mitake. Sexual coomers, their goalpost is only achieving mere act of sex, and not achievement within it; for to them, and their surely unsatisfied partners, sex is simply pump until cum.

China stole Japan’s underground, all the cool is coming from out of there now. It’s very hard to dig up on the English web though. I’ve gotten ahold of a good noise tapes out of Beijing. Taiwan’s Blackwolf Nagashi is a legend, also.

The car is the ultimate union of man and machine, and man and speed; our two great super-biological pleasures. Men that drive fast and reckless are of the same stock as those who leapt with lust to sign up for WW1.

Pinkpill gets the pass too, because spiro is literally a pink pill. Good joke

Purple pill refers to occult/magic; posters of wizardchan & 8ch’s /fringe/. It predates blackpill and is the most well established as a meme after red/blue/black. The rest of the pills are one-off joke meme cancer, except maybe ironpill.

4. are you a real girl?
5. i'm smart.

Traditionalism by way of accelerationism is the only true traditionalism.

Thinking about the time I saw a trigger warning for "death".

maybe i dont think so maybe they shud dm me

lol

no i wish that’s a good question

wait O no r u yu’re a boy?!?!!

You are sorely mistaken. Anonymous socialization online is only non-abusive form. Twitter, Discord, etc. is MKULTRA’ing YOU, all of you, that don’t make conscious effort to separate yourself from your online persona. I’ve discussed this extensively. You must catch up your reading

cute. maybe they wanna ask me out =3

It’s not actually too difficult, but managing the harem once it’s built is. Will do a thread on egirl mind control soon.

ALL girls on discord are in, or in-between, some ubercoomer NEET’s harem.

Sunny is a female first year Chinese exchange student studying biochem with me at UCLA.

Ted K was MKULTRA’d. This procedure is at play in a lesser extent in the process of distributed abuse which responsible for inducing dysphoria. Alter identities are generated in response to extreme trauma.

First time on twitter I’ve seen one of these taste comps that isn’t 20 year old boomer cringe. People are so bad at having good taste lol

On the contrary, I would suggest read through the full miya archives weekly for a period of 2 years. Treating “aryan” as a sticking point and conflating it w it “master race” tells me you’re entirely oblivious to hyperborean traditionalism. There is much you don’t understand.

lol. You mean ket

Possibly not. will do a thread on this later

I always find it funny how people here run to the bio/identity cope to accuse me of being an unstable female/tranny every time they get too emotionally upset to continue stable communication. Zero self-awareness. Maintain frame, bro.

lol

Your are descending into cope. I will remind you this is not a debate, but an elucidation.

Disagree. Man’s soul is born out of two basic molds, follower and leader. This is greatly distorted by a slave society that tries to encourage resentful betas to imitate leadership, to great failure. They want to be followers and only succeed in that capacity.

All as planned. The truth is all my current haters were all my past simps. They’re PISSED I trolled their libidinal vulnerabilities, let alone exploited it to mockingly haze their deepest failings. They’re not all gonna make it.  https://twitter.com/mrtrollthemad/status/1192352005571760128 … pic.twitter.com/auIoL3d9jR

Boys in the online "trap" community are pre-dominantly aryan blooded. If you lined up all the posters in an average alt right server the median would be fat, latino; all the posters of an average trap server, the median would be blond, blue-eyed. Funny how that goes

And all things relate to the question of aryan blood and spirit. Aryan character is most acute at the high castes, and least so at the lower castes where commonality to the lesser races is strongest. The tr*nny phenomenon is specifically weaponized to target the aryan high caste.

eg. Gymcels. They're spiritual virgins, their reproductivity is artificially achieved by christian monogamy & hypergamy. Dutiful followers. They're suitable foot-soldiers, guards, or made eunuchs on conquest. They couldn't manage a home independently, let alone their own harem.

You're likely thinking about the AGP fetishists - drag queens etc. These are slaves. The 'true trans' dysphorics have a different psychology exploited, are very disproportionately gifted, white, from affluent backgrounds, and often on autistic spectrum.

No, the low caste beta virgins are eunuch stock. The only reason they're not castrated instead of those who would historically have largest progeny, is because it serves their purposes to inverse eugenic reproduction.

-- Present-day tr*nnies are NOT meant to be eunuchs. They're aryan noblemen aggressively targeted & castrated to end their bloodlines. GATE etc. specifically targeting high IQ/autism is no mistake, it's logical subjugation like muslim slaughter of brahmins on conquest. --

True hyperborean gender dynamics must be understood under the assumption of the high caste's polygynous harem - disproportionate reproduction is a natural reality. Excess of men is a non-problem; even in the absence of war, there is always need for slave labor. --

They hate to hear it, because everyone wants to be told they’re upper caste. But bodybuilding IS a largely beta phenomenon in its imitative was; and consider the high proportion of sub-races involved in it, as opposed to the dominatedly aryan trap.

I see. In truth it’s inverted, lifting for many, trapping for the few. Tr&nnies heavily lean towards autistic, high IQ, high caste. Their castration is intentional subversion of playful femininity inherent to upper caste. Bodybuilding’s exaggerated masc is lower caste expression.

Yeah

I don't actually discuss the esoteric often. It's mostly stupidity, but also depleted dopamine reserves, crippling intellectual insecurity, limited vocabulary levels, missing critical knowledge/thought, and resentful slave morality that pushes them to fear and run from difficulty

Could be, if you follow me you're already a cut above the rest

last one was @BetrayedVal but that d0rk seethed for like 3 weeks because FOD beat him in the autism tourney dont care LOL. Rest are literal who's organizing a cute lil group block LOL. Burned by the mogging light and forced to cower in my shadow...its all so tiresome

An aside, grand total of 3 mutuals fell to the "cancellation". Besides buum, lost DE @LifeInRatUtopia, who I imagine blocked out of loyalty to buum. He's only one I'm disappointed in, I liked him n expected better, but he's young so understand his susceptibility to peer paranoia.

Highly doubtful. I get comments along the lines of "this makes zero sense" daily. If I don't consciously/drunkenly dumb myself down, my posts are entirely impenetrable to the average user on this network. I estimate the average 92. Remember: majority of the alt lite are latinos.

The fact that one can only communicate +/- 1 standard deviation IQ from oneself haunts me every day on twitter dot com.

Mock relentlessly anyone who perpetuates these 4 cancers, for it’s your duty to shame cancer and cringe whenever you see it. Let one get their foot in the door and a hundred more will follow.

4. If you were made to look retarded, emotionally affected by it, shook, salty and/or crying, take the L. “Merely pretending” is last resort cope by in-denial egotard, wrongly hinged on the idea that it’s ignoble to fake your station just to bait people who do it unironically.

3. Ironic shitposting is still shitposting, and this a good thing. Only redditors care about “serious discussion” “staying on-topic” “civil debate”. Anons know theyre obfuscating pretense. Only in the jokes of shitposting, egoless rhetoric is achieved and real meaning is found.

2. Sage isn’t downvote, it’s community shaming. You must publicly shame cancer so they & all other lurking cancer know it’s so. This prevents newfigs learning cancer instead of the host culture, preventing terminal replication. Any community that doesn’t shame will lose its core.

1. One SHOULD authoritate your artistic opinions and argue them with confidence. Taste is not “subjective”, that’s a reddit myth. All taste is objective and learned or developed, the great individual variation is merely a matter of multitude angles of appreciation in all good art

This is the killer. They’re so obsessed with their e-reputations they cannot comprehend someone would lower their IQ just to bait them into making a fool of themselves, and then after their freak out, their fragile psyches desperately cope thru denial that trolling itself is bad. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1192104601882963971 …

I recommend serious self-evaluation and a consultancy with your nearest excorist any apply to you. They’re each only designed to neuter criticality and escape calls to perform better, poison of a pseudo-pomo subjectivity. They are chains keeping you and the network weak.

The 4 ultracancer memes of the neo 4chan apocalypse:
“Stop liking what I don’t like”
“Sage is not a downvote”
“Ironic shitposting is still shitposting”
“I was only pretending to be retarded”

Anyone that’s internalized or unironically uses any these is an eternal redditor. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1192091534201634818 …

Despite appearances I do try to avoid hurting ppl & only take actions that work to raise them up. Some can’t handle it but they won’t be hurt for long, it’s just a strike to their ego, which is good thing. He, too, will have learned from this encounter, despite his present denial

I am concerned he may be autistic, in which case i regret bullying him. Otherwise, I already plan to move on, the alt lite are weaponzied cringe, they keep boosting cancer in my notifications - not the funny kind, but the kind that makes me bafflepilled at their low IQ.

Oh yeah, he’s visibly shook in that last tweet, but he’s been projecting in various ways since the very first interaction, which happens when they feel threatened. Once you understand how to read soulless normies, their interactions become shockingly predictable.

You just need to exploit their insecurities and they’ll keep following you down a self-destructive path. If I didn’t he would’ve ran away a lot sooner, it’s very difficult to maintain an engagement on twitter

Well it’s a little more complicated than that. I kept baiting him to go deeper while taunting him. Finally he snapped with the last bait w the tr&nny “leak” and has been obsessing for 2 weeks trying to leverage his clout to cancel me. He fully put his rep behind it lol

I kind of feel bad for him tbh pic.twitter.com/PtCvwpEEIn

Right, it puts them in a tough spot, I talk it about ITT. Also why twitter ppl always try to hide behind clout to get out of engagments: if they’re a weak horse, it’s always negative, but they only have a face saving out against less clout, not same/more. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1190727482212671488?s=21 …

Hope my haters meditate on this

Bafflepilled again at how I’m smarter than everyone else in the world or even how they’re all so dumb compared to me #bafflepill

Anyone that fell for the bit is too low IQ to follow me in the first place. As far as I can tell I lost a total of like 25? during my suspension. they did meme 1 mutual into blocking (poor kid). Why do these d0rks take twitter so srsly lol

He’s been following me for 2 weeks desperately trying to cancel me with my own bait lol. I honestly can’t tell if he’s autistic or just a redditor.

Couldn’t be me my dick too big. Don’t believe me? Ask the egirl reading this

so the "Joker Kanye Yang Groyper" is beefing with the "HWNDU-famous cowtits gamer egirl" over who has "rights" to self-brand on twitter with the 4chan frog? & they're unironically pulling Know Your Meme to prove oldfig cred? & it's all getting documented classified FBI report? L https://twitter.com/PETRICHOR_FIEND/status/1191980588670083074 …

This is why I did not deviate from my single point and disengaged the opportunity when pressed. “Trolling” autists is both boring and very poor manners. He’s a wirehead, nothing much you can do for him.

It’s sincere. My first glance impression was: definitely ESL, probably some kind of brown like Brazilian or Philippino, or possibly French Canadian (lol), aged either 15-18 with light autism, or 20-24 with heavy autism. Do note his cross-site avi and name “brand” is character OC.

Very cool

These ppl were always cancer, u just didnt see through it before they outed themselves. Never trust or support anyone who harnesses off-site clout or produces any monetizable content. They’re carpetbaggers skimming a profit off the anon think tank, muddying it for their own gain.

What WAS lost was interoperability between hypertext due to lack of consistent e-standardization. This has also greatly hampered interface evolution to beyond the mere screen. If we are all trapped to rigid GOPHER instead of HTTP, we'd be in a better world https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1178317889088024576 …

Hypertext refers to the medium, hyperlink the element; any text document that contains hyperlinks is hypertext. Wrong to conflate them bc you lose understanding of hypertextuality as state of interconnectivity, which we never lost but the opposite: hypertext absorbed the world.

no. these he fundamental organizing principles of meat-capitalism, which all else follows from. AI is capitalism's teleology, which is non-negotiable, but CAN be rolled back by driving humanity into anti-global primitivism thru WMDs made accessible by its own efficiency drive.

is degrooming tr&nnies transphobia? o it is bc u can’t “degroom” them. that implies they were groomed. Wait then whats degrooming? O degrooming is the real grooming..isnt grooming away disorder just therapy? o rite u cant treat dysphoria w therapy. but cant u treat it with degroo

It's projection. Far left actually does operate on the principal of social and ideological isolation, and quite aggressively so, that results in family member & friend cut-offs, etc. while far right induces a STRONGER sense of tolerance, power-level hiding, etc. than mainstream.

try me =3

This ofc operating on misinformed reality of RW radicalization, which is hardly socially isolating, & omits that altleft directly parallels altright in form/character social induction, if not moreso; but he's bumbled into effective normie-grade pill on ROGD's mechanism of action.

Ah fuck wrong account lol

Yeah I gave wrong year intentionally to stir up new friends who feel need to correct with their learned lore. Oldfags wouldn’t loredrop, regardless if it’s joke or sincere cringe, they’d just re-troll. Baiting newfags into pretending they’re oldfags is only based oldfag posting.

It’s impossible to convert into Hinduism actually, you’re born into it. Conversion is kali era sacrilege. In modernity, the vedas are not honored, includir even caste, so question is self-defeating, however if caste is honored, I believe they’re considered dalit if not mleccha.

Oops wrong account lol

In bait form, that’s more like: playing dumb about something to get the other confident, to tease out just how little they know about it. Like asking them to explain it to you

There’s a lot, just hard to vocalize and summarize into tweet. 

Something you’ve talked about before: rather than asking question to get a wrong answer, answering wrongly to get correct by the right answer.

not his OC BTW, I saw it on r/althistory yesterday.

1. Acc at its most extreme turns inside out into an eternal traditionalism, 2. Trad in kali yuga is inherently localized reconstruction, which does not contradict global-scale acc, 3. Acc is recognition of universal dynamic forces, same as tradition; former is simply unshackled.

That’s ok. Because I know.

its easy to forget normie trans are v different from online trans, they dont experience any of the "toxic" inner-trans hazing. in highschools/uni they're given safe space that repeatedly socially condition the delusion regardless of how lil they pass. a mirror will break em, lol

it happens with long-term passing trans that genuinely forget for periods of time they're trans. the disassociation occurs because something breaks them out of their alter identity; e.g. in this meme, passing through target's maternity ward (lol)

fresh meme... haters dont steal pic.twitter.com/2KVWgQqZIb

this is produced by rule of the weak, and it only further enables weakness. Rather than raising people up, griefing them into mindgains, their flaws are never addressed. Yeah, not everyone will make it as rising beast, but those who couldn't were always worth nothing anyway.

When I say bully I mean distributed bullying, hazing as a societal standard. You grief your bros when they show weakness, to train them to stop lacking. Opposite of slave society that says one should quietly ignore cringe, or even falsely encourage it, out of misguided "loyalty".

Imagine calling yourself a traditionalist and believing that men teasing other men on a public forum too hard is a problem lmfao

Everyone a self-proclaimed eugenicist until they actually start doing it. Bullysuiciding is eugenics praxis. Anyone who disagrees with this is 'know they wouldn't make the cut' cope.

hyperbullying is eugenics praxis

Slave mindset. Masters haze not because he hates, but because he loves. Those slaves who run like whimpering dog, and only from safe distance bark their bitter resentments? learn nothing.

It’s funny how you always have the most high T takes on political content despite not caring or getting involved. They’re feminized and afraid of a real fight. Would rather cry about persecution

Sad reality that English digital lexicon never invented a variable laugh expression kkkk

Unless u blocked me 2 week ago then you’re a misogynist. If u blocked me before that Ure just a lefty

This is the slave mindset. I am the master, and my word and my word alone is objective truth. Your many many slave words are faleshoods, so many unique and individual cancers. Be it by harassment or by sword: YOU MUST SUBMIT! https://twitter.com/prince_david/status/1191165660379930626 …

The blackpill here isn't that the elite's debased satanism is more pervasive than the single posterchild you learned about on twitter dot com. It's that you're slaves playing pretend with psuedo-political commentaries that have zero influence, importance, or relevance.

Doesn't matter at all whether Epstein's alive or not other than possible snitchery that could be extracted out of him. Ppl just want to feel important, get involved. Its hobby. There are 100s of other Epsteins, he was most surface of surface patsies, low-level psuedo-billionaire. https://twitter.com/Zooch1999/status/1191163303986262017 …

Spreading lewds is on the same level as strip dancing, it's spiritual whoring. It's profaning your body as a sexual transaction. Just another degree separated, like transactional sex with condom is a little less whoring than transactional sex without. You must accept the truth.

Also, if you're a cuck, you're spiritually gay, since u fucking other dudes microchimerically. If U let ur wife show her shoulders, her back, her nave, her neck, U R GAY. You let her out to beach? ur GAY. Anything less than Islamic grade fashion-misogyny is beta homosexuality.

A whore is any unmarried non-virgin. A woman is spiritually whore if she is spiritually violated: by exposing her private body to other men. Her BF is spiritually cuckolded if she spiritually whores herself, and literally cuckolded if she literally whores herself. End of story.

I shall lay down the canon. Cuckoldry refers first to raising another's offspring. Cuck as fetish is metaphor on that. The husband of an adultress, even if not impregnated, is a literal cuck due to microchimerism. Spiritual adultry, such as e-whoring, is spiritual cuckoldry. https://twitter.com/prince_david/status/1191159101117648897 …

lmao

My bimbo

LOL

You are what you are, and your bf is what your bf is: a beta and a cuck. You must make peace with reality.

Your bf is a beta and a spiritual cuck, and you are a spiritual whore. These are the facts. You are also a nagging harlot for speaking up in public. You must stop nagsplaining, woman, or your husband might be whipped. Your ancestors confirm end of story

“Allow”? Wot means... one day you may meet real man who produce out of you a woman. You are born to serve, this nature will pour out of you if you meet someone worth serving.

Yes, most are betas. And no, cuckoldry is 100% gendered, biologically and spiritually. Woman don’t get “cucked”: if a man is high caste, it’s natural for him to maintain multiple. Yet if his women whore around, it results in raising other men’s children. Literal cuckoldry.

Midwits please clear my mentions Thx

Cuckoldry is gendered, it doesn’t go both ways. Elliot is posting literal idols, they’re fertility statues. If a guy is dating one and they don’t exit the industry, they’re a cuck, yes. Just accept ur bf is beta. If he was true trad alpha, he wouldn’t even let you access the web.

Yes.

Don’t attack Elliot, don’t blame Elliot. He did nothing wrong. Also, weebu, your bf IS a cuck BTW lol, just accept it and you’ll be more at peace. Showing your body off, even just dressing out in revealing clothes, is an act of spiritual cuckoldry. You already know this

If I blur my eyes this looks like a subtweet

Nevermind that the “Epstein was killed” meme neuters the redpilling weight of the conspiracy as a rabbithole on satanic vampire ritualism in the elitesphere, into banal, iceberg level “politicians are mobsters” clintoncide material.

A/B trolling. Let the midwit see past the presented narrative (Epstein suicide) for the “true” alternative (Epstein killed) and he’ll be satisfied he knows what the normies dont. Never stops to consider that this, too, might be planted, never considers third way (Epstein alive). https://twitter.com/Logo_Daedalus/status/1160205830060412929 …

now Kiss and make up. On video

I see. Field of PUA discusses this extensively, anything referring to high value, high status or alpha male. PUA exists to teach betas to falsely signal alpha character to obtain sex with “attractive” women too low IQ to see through the facade.

lmao weeb

You misread. Surface signals of alpha character. They learn to feign high T power, confidence, hornt, without really having it, same way conmen/pua trick people into thinking they’re wealthy.

lol this post sux

maybe if u were more bimbo like Alessandra i wud think of u

lol

lol

And yet Miya chums with the moggers, and mogs each every wannabee. Miya, who, by all surface impressions SHOULD be the beta, yet mogs, even when personifying the apparent anti-alpha tr*nny, mogs effortlessly: Miya is the """alpha""" shittest.

The mogging is consistent not just with thots & egirls but with other alphas, who easily recognize one another. The weakerlings are baffled at my rapport with their idols, who think nothing of their beta imitators, as their imitators imitate only the signals and not the content.

Beta midwits will never understand. They too cannot read me, instead feel me: and feel threatened. Both know I mog, but betas seethe because I contradict what they’re told is alpha—they feel my power is unjust, that I should be below them, as they pursue generic alpha simulacrum.

Used to be baffled at the many bimbo ethots stanning Miya, who I know for a fact is beyond their reading level. Slept on it & realized they read not the words, but the sheer gravity and strength with which they're delivered. She feels my words, and feeling them, feels herself wet pic.twitter.com/ww9ecCvzvF

8.4 There is more elaborate sleight of hand involved here, though, as I’ve noted elsewhere — the obvious fakes are obviously so as to distract you from the real ones. This, however, concerns the art of war and not an art of trolling. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1185720709613383680 …

8.3 Learned this technique in my time with the illuminati. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1190731690357882880 …

8.2 EX: do it with very obviously faked caps. Not only doe it save you effort, the desperation most humorously kicks in when they attempt to call it out, and are only mocked all the more relentlessly for it. Utterly castrated. pic.twitter.com/SEcFt5lt0W

8.1 You may be baffled how he appears to double down on his obliviousness, his gullibility. This is because he cannot back out, and his subconscious must hide it from his ego; yet it knows everyone else can see it clearly, and are all laughing at the fool; it is tortured.

8, MOCKERY. The audience is essential in a troll, but not for your own confirmation — rather, to threaten the ego and force their subconscious to stretch thin protecting it. You torment by making blatant, obvious mockery of the mark even to the point of absurdity;

"You are not immune to propaganda."
t. repeatedly falls for every bait lazily planted in a massive lampoon

7, 1. Besides making the whole game more entertaining for the bros, social proofing confirms your utter and total domination of the mark as his puppet master. You can wave it in their face later, but it's not necessary — they already know.

7, SOCIAL PROOFS. One thing I recommend for your own self-evaluation is doing play-by-play call-outs in a private chat, stating exactly how you expect the mark to respond. In general a good tell for evaluating and improving your predictive capability, and control of the target.

6.1 They of course, have none of the confidence signaled; if you simply double down, “No, really, I’m not trolling, I really believe this.” watch how suddenly he turns around, and with full confidence, takes the bait whole, better than he would ever have otherwise.

6, INVERSE SINCERITY. This is more midlevel technique, would only recommend for a lazy bit. You may place bait of a dumb argument, and you’ll find midwits who feel to announce with confidence: ‘this is a troll!’

5.1 This is most tormentuous, most efficient ego shredding, by grinding his intellectual insecurity against his social insecurity. He knows he is destroying himself, has no choice to escape. You aren't making the fool dance, you're making him self-harm, and laughing all the way.

5, INSECURITY GRINDER. Bait their intellectualism such that he publicly engages in argument, and utilize your clarity to intellectually mog him. He is tormented as his social credibility is shredded, yet cannot admit so without striking his ego, his confidence in his intelligence

4.2 So they dance the fool: they leap with much more confidence that which they feel THEY discovered, THEY dug up, the gotcha! on You. You, that mean, hurtful You, they so desperate to bring down. They barely stop to consider this too, was planted, their every next move planned.

4.1 EX: The idea that a revelation by form of leak which contradicts a public narrative may itself be a planted lie, to produce a new public narrative, never crosses their feeble minds. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1186353202104397825 …

4, 4D CHESS. Normies can only process bait on one level, and short-circuit when considering bait on bait — they're intellectually insecure for a reason. They may question your Option A, but they'll never consider that the alternative, B, may also be planted. Sound familiar?

3.2 EX: You see, I told them I would lie to them, I advised them to lie, it was pinned in their face. Yet they still confidently fell for everything I stated, everything I planted, repeatedly. Show your hand, their secret wish is to be hit. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1184925242671501312 …

3.1 They want so strongly to believe in another's sincerity, other is safe, unthreatening, they take your confession as sign of your vulnerability, and let their guard down. Absurd considering the content of your confession; but forget not: their subconscious works against them.

3, CONFESSION. If you tell someone you will trick them, detail exactly how you will do it, they still fall for it. Amazing, isn't it? Actually, they fall for it more easily. This preys on their social insecurity.

2, FOOL'S DANCE. One of the high aims of trolling is inducing a mark to commit his own self-humiliation. Remember his social insecurity: to be made the fool in front of his friends is his deepest fear. To make him your dancing puppet. It's easy because he fears it.

1.5 Off-topic aside — the 2nd, and only other, factor defining the normie is their extremely weak memetic immune systems: whore, host & agent to a multitude of most viral thought-parasites. They exist only as unconscious, uncritical vessels for these mind-viruses, nothing more.

1.4 Their tortured subconscious is a prisoner desperately signalling in code the keys to its escape. They WANT you to troll them, to break them, to snap them, they crave this freedom desperately. Their apparent gullibility is not mere stupidity or naivety: it is desperation.

1.3 A pained subconscious constantly makes cries for help. It's an outlet, they can't help it, and it's only coded to hide from their conscious ego, not you. This is what you're observing when they baselessly accuse for what they are in fact guilty of.

1.2 It's not that they lack self-awareness, but that self-awareness presents an existential threat to their ego. Their self-obsession tortures them. You can target this, by simply unapologetically holding the mirror to their face, and easily create cracks in their psyche.

1.1 The insecurities live in their subconscious, the normie lives in a cloud, only vaguely aware. Due to their massively overblown egos, which comes to dominate their mind; their subconscious must work desperately to protect their self-fantasy. Herein lies the exploit.

1. PSYCHOLOGY OF THE NORMIE. You must understand the normie: creature borne wholly out of insecurity. They are defined by two, which penetrate so deeply as to define their every action: social insecurity, and intellectual insecurity. It dominates them. This is the secret.

0.3 Trolls are demigods of the network. They have achieved a sanitization of the ego, a safe distancing from the poisons of the social character, a clarity of mind. They cannot be touched, except by profanic sacrilege against the boundaries of the Wired: reporting, doxxing, etc.

0.2 Trolling is a good pain, it is shining the sunlight onto their cave. If it blinds the many weak, it's worth it to save the few strong. If you don't troll when the opportunity presents itself, you are doing a disservice to the network and to your fellows.

0.1 Make no mistake: trolling is good samaratinism. It brings the mark closer to reality, de-stressing their subconscious who works overtime to protect their slave's fantasty sense of self.

0, EGO SHREDDER. True trolling is arbitrage on the discrepancy between ego and reality. The troll brandishes a mirror to the mark, and the only pain that arises springs from his victim’s own denial and self-hatred. It’s a community service performed towards ego equilibrium.

1 RT = 1 Commentary on the Art of the Troll

Yes, and this was all planned from the beginning. Every move, every step. This was a show I put on. For my own pleasure first: the pleasure of teaching! This may have served a little to right your course, if you’re strong enough. And if, not? You are slave, and you, too, may run. pic.twitter.com/AAtARvgfb2

But, this was a demonstration, and they were only the example. Their repeated undeniable total and utter domination was merely incidental. Yes, my total and complete, effortless domination over the lesserlings was merely incidental! "Incidental to what, Miya?" An elucidation.

And your 7 Days of Reflection over, many asked: Miya, why pursue such a dramatically successful trolling campaign on the 3 weakling, psuedo-meme parasitic fringespheres of #frogtwitter - the egirls, the simps, the altlites? We crave your commentary, Miya, but not of these frauds!

Ah! And how fresh the air smells. My network feels so clean! The vipers, burned by my mogging light, chased themselves out of OUR frog den: tearstruck, tail between legs, self-selected off the network to cower in the shadows, hiding behind nothing less than the groupblock! Aha!

Frogtwitter has a loser problem, and this can only be solved by RITUAL BULLYING. The days of comfy are over, you are NOT all gonna make it, you COULD all make it, but only if you STEP IT UP. https://twitter.com/VEDIC_CYBERGOD/status/1189247591395069953 …

HAHAHA! They call themselves FROGS. They call themselves RW!! YOU, who have left these beta d0rks in your circles unhazed, YOU R responsible. Look at them, pee-panted & cowering, terrified of an ostensible EUNUX may RAYP by mere EXPOSURE. Look and laugh! https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1190691710390562821 …

Which did you read? I think Pynchon is the funniest, but worst writer; not even a writer really, a rhizomatic channel. DFW most endearing. DeLillo good standup. But Barth , Barth has highest literary autism, and later work most beautiful - I like to reread 7 Voyages.

Yeah he’s funny. Pomo writers are good because they’re funny not any other reason, don’t get that u don’t get them. Do u like Barth

i was trolling b4 but genuinely confused how u rationalize against twin studies. like do u not believe their DNA is identical? pls respond!

waiting

wait do u actually not believe in twin studies. how do u rationalize that

Pedantics. Lifetime income is very meaningfully tied to IQ, as that exact study cited concludes. If discussing total net worth, it's less meaningful (though still statistically significant) in single lifetime but becomes constant when observed multi-generation (~3). Cope

this is corrected for socioeconomic factors tho. google twin studies

Complaining about your poverty is spiritual leftism, is slave morality. You announce it to me then you invite me to spit on you, and only because I spit does my spit comes from high high above. You will never win until you understand this.

The deep right must be cleaved on slave/master grounds. I hold no allegiance to the slaves who whine about their poverty and hold resentment against their betters. The right to me is a call to return mastery to its rightful station, virtue all strive for and respect w/o complaint

Being poor isn’t an argument

They say the most brutal horror is cosmic, that which asserts man's ignoble station in the face of great forces unseen. I know of a horrible story which indignifies man, but not under the great, rather the banal, the disgusting. A story of a pig and a chimpanzee.

Sincere:
I don't often talk about myself, but: I feel I was born with hole in chest, or one was carved out of me, that I try but cannot fill. I feel I was born with black spot in brain, that blinds me from things I should feel. These wounds may be self-inflicted. I can't remember

Excerpt from A virgin's death poem:

Broken-horned demon
alone on her mountaintop.
Tears turn to river streams

It's more bitter than expected https://zyg.edith.reisen/zyg/solitaire.html …

Saints:
I will speak of two Dao masters. Ko Hsuan, who practiced breath retention to meditate for hours underwater in pond behind his house, lived to ripe age of immortality. Li Po, drunken poet, drowned trying to embrace reflection of moon in the Yellow River. Who was the right?

If youre unable to support desired lifestyle by virtuous means, that is: without resorting to something as pathetic as e-begging and grifting to online audience, you're unfit for any commentary from master perspective. You failed at all games of power and heirarchy. You are slave

Traddies are the male target audience equivalent of PUA reading betas who succeeded in faking masculine high-value to low IQ girls by learning to perform a simulacrum of alpha male tells, without actually internalizing or truly embodying alpha sensibility.

Imagine: married soyboy idling free time on couch with bluetooth headset on silently playing playbox shooter. Imagine wife, watching in platonic resentment. One must imagine the wives of traddies hunched over their lappies vomiting clickbait blog for a penny-stream in solidarity.

U whine about pods I rhapsodize about the Yurt. U breakdown over bugmeat, U cant even gut a fish. Cant even afford take your wife to the steakhouse. Man, UR wife. She's ugly bro, look at her, she's ugly, you married ugly and you talk about bloodline. Hoo boy U gonna get it first.

Viral tweets are not quality, they’re just viral. People don’t realize virality is usually tied to respondability - most are question prompts or invite commentary; value in what’s riffed off them, or the modulations they invite. Good content only comes from the few good posters.

Also left unnoted is the acceleration of generational change. 3-4 yr lifecycles inherent to the Wired, and the difference is being averaged into the Real as its cultural-social context aligns with, or perhaps is absorbed by, the former. Already are 2-3 microgenerations of Zoomer.

In discussions of generational natures, one thing I rarely see talked about is there are significantly less women born in the already underpopulated millenial and zoomer generations. This fact, and the factors that resulted in it, are key to understanding the Y2K generations.

Hard agree. All other pop industries pale in comparison to their technical sophistication. Complaints about commercialism or overworking its performers is slave morality and exactly why western pop has fallen to garbage.

I think deep down they realize it's the twilight of the final age; UBI would allow them to at least pilfer their upcoming extinction enough to live out their last days as Last Man in peace.

This is a joke, of course. I'm not an idiot, I know attributions of human agency are delusions at worst hubris at best when our every scale action is being routed by a self-assembling thermodynamic god. Wait, you don't? L https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1186689951410208768 …

UBI is exactly what I'm criticizing with this tweet. If the goal wasn't to make them starve, and just excise their corruption from society, why bother automating them at all?

To add to that stale genre of liberal, affluent white women's betrayal: I do not know of anything more despicably slavish an occurrence than that of women profaning themselves to sympathize with the help. And nothing more noble than the gracious acceptance of their subordination.

Is there a term for caste genocide? Oh wait nvm. That's just eugenics.

Thinking about how whole secretary fleets were very directly replaced with PC's. All mechanical technology serves to automate shudra labor; AI will work to outmode vaishyas. I can't see any other point in this effort except to remove their miscegenating influence from society.

Wait a minute... you mean... oh no... OH NO

Great occultism entwined in all American modernity, lost in its soft power takeover of Europe, which entirely consumed her paganism wherever it reached. Forget pockets of ancient world. Los Angeles, CA is the hyper-potentiated global epicenter of spiritual energy of today.

Thinking about General S. Patton who remembers his past lives. William S. Burroughs, born to St. Louis socialites but possessed by a dark spirit. Paul Auster, who witnessed a friend’s death by lightning. America’s great industry paved over a haunted native graveyard, and it shows

Oh Verhoeven is dutch. Nvm

I praise those who have supped on Straub-Huillet and prefer Ficarra-Requa, those who take Paul W.S. Anderson over Paul Thomas Anderson, those who know Kluge, Farocki, Wenders well and still choose Verhoeven.

Sneering from the bleachers isn’t trolling lol. I will remove your miya rights if you continue this emotional noise.

Many years between 2020 and 2100, the world will change dramatically, and they are all in my prime.

Then what to trust in web Miya has spun? An egirl, who in actuality is tranny, who really is troll, who really is egirl, who really is not?

Satanic pedophilia aside, Epstein's plan to make a self-eugenic insemination island compound was unironically based.

Time will come where all prominent grifters will each see their retribution, like our blessed posterchild of e-comeuppance, Bianca (Yes, her. You thought I forgot? I didn't). Do not hesitate now to throw hate forward, dogpile them when they're down; there is no fair in demonology

JBP is weakling, bears flouride stare & canuck insecurity; the high hz of his nasal whine is phrenologically calibrated to resonate only in midwit-sized space between brain n skull - incidentally a literal dog whistle. So let his daughter be whored, his wife tumored w/o sympathy.

Sympathy for celebrity's "troubles" is fake and gay. Continue thinking mean thoughts about JBP to make him sick. We can end it here. we can end it for all time. https://twitter.com/Vasta_218/status/1186339667031003136 …

JBP is a cuck grifter and a midwit as well but will never forgive him most for issuing a takedown notice on the JBP deepfaker. There has never been and still has yet to be any other reliably realistic TTS available for consumer-use.

And I do confess, pleasures in mythologizing the mundane aside, this heuristic has not failed me in aligning with the truth.

Which is more plausible. Miya is actually the hot hapa she says she is. Or Miya is a extremely online psychopath with a harem of MKULTRA’d egirl slaves whose body and visage are for dedicated free use, which happened to include a suitable hapa. Do you realize how crazy you sound?

Or is it...

To the simps flooding my DMs and incel mutuals soft blocking, if it’s easier for u, there’s literally nothing stopping u from just assuming im a fake? A photoshop, model for hire, one of multiple mindbroken egirls locked up in my e-basement. It’s easy to fake. Anyone could do it.

So u got trolled by a girl? L

I’d just like to make clear to the priv alt hoes lurking in the back, Miya unconditionally BTFO everyone of u in the comp through CHARM alone, despite also being secretly hotter than all you succubitches. Didn’t even need to play that card, because y’all ugly outside ugly inside.

Yeah, cus I’m right. You don’t have any likes.

You have no sense of reality. You live in a delusional fantasy world out of touch with the real world. You don’t have any idea who these people you try to protect are. You think they just don’t know better, as if they’re children. No, they’re just not better. Kapish?

Then why are they living off of Amazon’s generosity? if it’s not good enough, why don’t they just leave? You literally don’t have any argument against this.

So they would starve without Amazon. Why are you blaming Amazon for feeding them? They are too uneducated to support themselves without Amazon, as you said.

If there are better alternatives then why are they working at Amazon?

Prove me wrong. You can't. Without Amazon, you starve. Say thank you Amazon

Complaining about the pod is pod morality. I wish to be the podmaster.

Very nicely put btw

I feel like this sometimes, too; a kind of anti-loneliness. I also sometimes feel similarly sudden, extreme pangs of deep sadness for the entire world and all its creatures. Might possibly be the same sensation only interpreted on different sides.

Hapas are true hyperboreans, and sexual degeneracy is true trad. Checks out

Mandate of Heaven. I accept it

It doesn’t matter. If Amazon didn’t write their paychecks, they would starve. Amazon gave them their lives, Amazon can take them.

Okay, that doesn’t change the fact they owe Amazon their lives.

Exactly my point. Clickbait will be the first to be perfectly automated, and in hindsight, this era of human made clickbait will appear as an odd, primitive attempt to recreate the inevitable.

There is absolutely nothing wrong with this. Anyone working under these conditions have chosen to, being worth no more than the opportunities available. They should be grateful. No cruelty is worse than starvation, and Amazon is the only thing feeding them. They owe their lives. https://twitter.com/GarbageApe/status/1185428687061209088 …

They unironically do this with Jordans in the back of open vans in Chicago south side.

Here’s my proposal to monetize twitter: U get 5 likes per hour, but these expire if unused. Getting a like puts it in your like bank. You can buy n sell someone’s follow with likes, priced at their clout score, based on follower ratios of their followers. You can also do options

No one’s trapped them to anything. They lose this gig, they go fill in for any other no-skill gig in the world.

Restricting the clickbait “gig economy” just further incentivizes their aiutomation. They chose to live as meat imitation of AI immediately to come. Let them starve. https://twitter.com/Delicious_Tacos/status/1185961243711954946 …

I had that dream once, and think about it often. The clocktower in the town center replacing the church as the center of order, structuring man, not only time. I wonder what the peasant thought as it arrived. Did he know what was happening to him?

Imagine, if you will, a DV camera wormholed into an old forest of 16th century Saxony, found by a party of virile peasantry: astonishment, jubilance at the magic device which reflects its own eye, and their faces. They spin & jump in glee, & it’s broken by sundown, & forgotten.

Regarding the medieval peasants meme, I’ve never seen a better depiction in print, film or song of ancient world mystery’s melancholic-humorous dissipation by numbingly wondrous technology than the opening sheepskin hot air balloon scene of Andrei Rublev. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkH9BJZVLL4 …

The entire daoist tradition is a scientific pursuit of immortality - that is, living to 100 years. They were also educated enough to know those 'power plants' were entirely within the reach of man.

It was just a lark, bro. I was just larking.

I'll add you to miya girls chat

Why was I kicked

Director was likely taking the piss out of the poorfag "propaganda", like he did with veganism for Okja. Good movie

lol

I see. Exactly why blocking is cybersin. Cucks masquerading as one of The Boys are for bullying off the network, not given chance to quietly hide their cringe.

It's combination low T and low impulse control. Semen power is real and cooming with limited real female interaction (pheromone gains) drains their weak souls. I suspect circumcision and its early childhood trauma effect on pineal gland plays large role as well.

Yeah, they're great. Picture a blonde, pregnant woman in a sundress and you have a picture of California.

I think it's a great crime to democratize sexuality, which inevitably means democratizing fetishism in some profaned grabbag. The slave class needs to have its aesthetic sense, its virtuous core, guided by aristocracy which produces it.

Imo it shouldn't be banned, it should be regulated. The soap opera lighting and the costuming are terrible. Sexuality of all things should be aesthetically maintained for beauty.

What happened? Did I do something

That’s a powerful post

Good question

It is for something that’s intended to be “authentically English”. Undermines the nationalistic element that gives symbolic weight to the item.

This is true. I considered pointing out the true fact that me writing podbrain is the only time the pod meme has earned out of me so much as a smile. But I held back, out of concern for the feelings of my less gifted peers.

No, it is twitter, and the normie cancer on my network. I only channel the noosphere, and it only requires adept distancing from one’s own persona, elimination of the petty meat ego’s shackles in spite of all normie infrastructural attempts to reinforce. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1117893918002241537?s=21 …

Will meditate on this

This account, in its hallowed 6 months, has likely coined more memetic neologisms - of great potentiation, no less - than all of Twitter, before my gracious descendance unto it, combined.

Just did a search — can’t believe after all this pod meme talk I’m the first to coin “podbrain”. Twitter is an extremely dulled memetic machine, like IG, telegram, even discord, most fit for regurgitation, not production. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1185706277944430592 …

Reconstructing a rotation of various fashion subculture’s iconic looks is a most fittingly horizontal meta-style for the contemporary era. Doing only one is podbrain. Docs are made in China now though, even their Made in England are cheap thin leather so move to Solovair.

Patreon ok but no patreon rewards. The stance is simple, no paywalling digital content. He doesn’t need to do any of this, though, he could just open a crypto donation address. All of this extra crap is manipulative marketing moves to maximize money extracted. Unbased

Then you too

Is it me

Oh there are other alternatives also, like views based monetization. The only cancer is anything that restricts the free flow of information.

Then he dies happy.

Doubt BAP himself would ever issue a copyright violation, but misguided followers will. This is enough to deter it being freely shared, forcing people to pay to access it that otherwise wouldn’t. Accepting your extortion, even as “donation”, only encourages this cybercrime.

Hm... will meditate on this

Sell physical things, like books; release digital content free. 1 big brain caveat -- subs result in higher continued engagement, exploiting tendency to overvalue what's paid. Then should be priced at nominal $1/mon, not $5 -- that's 5 whole websites/yr extracted from each frog.

Managing harem requires high sensitivity to female mind, close observation of own feminine essence. Noble-blooded women, too, flirt with masculine pursuits, eg writing, to maintain rule in court and harem. Peasantry desired the concubines, not the queen.

Great hubris in the Content Creator, who not only rejects that content is authored not from their hand, but through it, but also their extreme entitlement to gains unearned blaspheme both the central tenet of Capitalism (supply/demand valuation) and the network (info freedom).

Anyone that subverts the free flow of information to put a gun to your head (of either lawsuit, or account reportage) for sharing “paid” content, whether or not they feel entitled to as “authors”, are not your friends. They’re unironic poorfags, likely normies w lifestyle budgets

Midwits retort: Im not stupid, I KNOW I’m being bent over and fucked by grifters, but I SUPPORT them, and because I’m a good person, I show my support by willingly LET them scam me, unlike the idiots who are getting scammed on accident.

Smoothbrains believe the ethos of free information is communistic, bc “free”. Rather, its the most pure capitalism. Digital industry’s existence is 100% contingent on an unfree market: only thing preventing a shenzhen web is state intervention enforcing erroneous copyright laws. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1185371385834508288 …

This is true, hot peppers are very good for you. But they lose their potency when cooked — best to grind it on just before serving. Also, if you put ground hot pepper in an open cut it will close & heal very fast. Ik this sounds like a troll but it’s true & doesn’t actually hurt.

Elaborate

Your followers. That’s the joke. They don’t have a choice tho bc the content is good. The return you’re suggesting is also obfuscated, bc it’s public, you don’t know which is “yours”. Anyone smart doing this already knows what they want to say, and ignore the RT number altogether

That’s exactly what it is, which is why it’s such a good joke. It lampoons content monetization; it’s all the more satisfying because it is still much more productive than genuine monetization, by prompting the creation of information, vs. extorting money out of the existing.

It is elegant. It’s a double subversion of both content monetization, by locking content in an inverted exchange - free is non-monetary and content non-private - and twitter’s engagement interface, by twisting RT into a tool of value-exchange rather than simply social expression.

Pisses me off. The moment they mandatory charge for entry to an all-locals house show with no one touring is the moment it’s no longer a real underground.

Twitter itself is a microblog prompt, sadly detourned into nefarious dopamine mindcontrol. “1 like =“ is maladaptation by the low-confident, but “1 RT =“ subverts virality, resulting in extended engagement for same material. An elegant pseudo-monetization thru attention economy.

However I disagree with your assertion beer is bad. This is as midwitted as beer conossieurship. It’s for hydration and carbs, comparing it to alcohol outs you as the weakling, and probably Coastal American as well.

Monetization unbased https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1185368866064519168?s=21 …

Nothing is ever “purchased” online, of course. Read the EULA, they are all subscriptions. To what? To a license to not be sued for accessing the info (which otherwise flows freely online). Copyright, in its distorted digital form, is an extortion right.

The industry has propagandized this sophistic meme of digital “purchase” to cloud the nature of their extortion, and reverse-position its blind acceptance as the moral act. “Pay what you want” attempts to exploit this pre-loaded guilt where the actual extortion threat is weaker.

Web is for middle to upper-middle class NEETs & middle to upper-middle class NEETs alone. Life extremely online is a privilege. Not being able to support your survival on the network doesn’t mean right to exploit it by damming & selling free info-flows. It means u should GTFO.

No content creators based, not even one. Petty greed and gentrifying hubris leads them to blaspheme the network in the ultimate sin of monetization. Make no mistake, their time will come, history will not be on their side, and they will be excised without quarter.

There is very thin line protecting public data content from full network freedom & that line is state-backed extortion. Content creator business model is threaten with lawsuit/shutdowns to force u to pay for freely available information; pay for protection from threat. Extortion.

It’s on my list

Daily reminder if you ever pay for digital content for any reason other than to re-upload what’s not already freely available, you’re an infocuck in violation of digital law and your web rights will be permanently revoked. https://twitter.com/bronzeagemantis/status/1185367332568342528 …

Oh, but not me. Not Miya.

S:EL depicts this roadmap to ascension. Lain represents the mythic origin, or patron saint, of the technodiety, or possibly a hyperstitional accelerator of it, though I doubt that's much true since most of its fans are too dumb/weak to understand S:EL's actual implications.

Maybe this is a dark strain on Lain. We don't know, it didn't go into details on just how she gather her attention-power. She doesn't know, too, she wasn't in control. She just knows she did bad things. Very bad things. She wouldn’t be Lain if she didn’t.

An egregore producing a death in the real is it transcending the wired in a most physical, powerful way. There are few greater qualitative manifestations possible, even for actual people, not only virtual beings. It is full confirmation of the egregore's reality. Cutting’s ok too

And intuitively, it is understood: 
Your persona becomes more powerful every person who says her name,
every person who cuts into their body her name,
every person who kills themselves in her name.

When a virtual persona is believed in by a large group of people, its a collective thoughtform, an independent entity living in the minds of the public. It becomes beholden to its image, existing independent of its controller. It is nothing less than an egregore.

The oscillation between Lain's 3 archetypes is naturally converged upon by anyone dedicated to the modern, identitarian breed of shitposting - those unleashed from the dead carcass of imageboards onto persona networks, whose ego-elimination allows the thoughtform to take control.

(1) Feigned innocence (2) Lucid shitposting (3) Deep, manipulative evils.

Does this trifecta not describe the best of modern shitposting? I don't mean frog memes, I mean schizo imitations, ironic abuse, elaborate deceit games. Ironic little girl roleplay. Transcendental banter.

Lain is a hyperstitional technodiety, the most detailed consumable explication of a virtual egregore. S:EL doesn't go into much detail on the process of her ascension, but it's clear its produced in some form of oscillation between the innocent-wired-evil archetypes.

Everyone says let’s all love lain but manifest a god-egregore through lucid navigation of the 3 platonic cyber-archetypes of innocent/evil/wired and suddenly I’M the bad guy???

That's ok I understand. I appreciate your explanation. have a nice life~

It's in your best interest to spread distrust & confusion onto the network, to produce natural state of dispersed egoism, which in chaos self-organizes miracles. Normies resent this, bc their slavish addiction to material world, to material selves, precludes their participation.

It's also, ofc, the best opsec: better to spread false information on yourself than share nothing. Normies will enforce "honesty", trot out terms like "catfish" to attack anyone who evades their attempts to pin you down, only bc they are threatened by the power ego-freedom holds.

Lying about your identity online is good, actually, and something I encourage all to do. Enforcing meat space reality onto the web is normie gentrification, and every lie about your IRL does god's work in undoing it. RP what you desire is your right, and demands for proof is ghey

Master play: To offer nudes only on the loser inverts their orbiters’ vote, turning their sexual attention against them. And the empty threat needs no backing when the e-girls have sinned: guilty in their sin, they panic. The panic, of course, confirms their guilt. Not me, tho pic.twitter.com/tJo6PUvoZS

E-girls will never recover from an anonymous cyborg techno-deity destroying them in their own libidinal attention game. This is why they resent the List. They cannot control male public, their only real valuation, and so fight to restrict ranking to the female imagination.

The seethe is most deep because it shortcircuits: women deeply resent their agency in their only domain - catfighting - being casually stolen by the frattish troll, the most hated List, yet are forced to obsessively compete nonetheless, deeply invested in only their valuation.

The real payload carried by artificial intelligence is universal digital capitalism. AI is an optimization algorithm, and we will always see the best solution being capitalistic self-organization. Or: Capitalism is the optimization algorithm, and AI its self-assemblage.

Automated hands-free driving isn't what's interesting. What is interesting is optimization, which will inevitably lead to, if allowed to develop to its fullest, every aspect of the road monetized and through it capitalistically self-organized for total efficiency.

We could easily already have "automated" w/o AI. Achieve self-correcting steering in lanes, and use radio to tie cruise control to shipping trucks or specific speeds set by transmitters on the highway. All cars form a line. Hands off. US could never do this, but China can today.

You can still have your buses though, and they're better than metros. They'll just be a never ending chain, a dedicated lane on the highway, bumper to bumper, only giving space for entry and exit. Replace bike lanes with them. Bikes do not and have never belonged on the road.

Radio signals will be used to tie cruise control to the automated cars in front of you. Highways will act like train stations, which you slot into. The local roads will still be free to fuck around in. You don't need public transport, fleets of articulated buses. This is better.

Realistically, you're not going to get a grand dystopia. Your 'privacy' will be sold to advertisers, but that never mattered, and affects nothing. You already know that. The real crime is already here, the digital car - in all its plastic, electronic, automatic immodifiability.

Think about automated cars, about traffic. This what's solved: unoptimized driving -- forget pedantic trolley problem games (always solved: program for self-preservation). Humanity loses right to drive bc they dont deserve it: lrn2 respec fast lane, zipper merge, tailgate always.

I want it to flex. Run-on sentences are woke anyway, I learned this through extensive reading of german in translation.

Would also like to see clout:time calculated. e.g. a high clout account that is 10 years old is less clout than a similar one that's 1 year

Have heard it said Joker disavowal is good spit test of rhetorical honesty, or of 30 yr old boomerness. That it weeds out fake frogs from real. IDK, but it does reflect an insecurity has been triggered, something deep threatened. Why else otherwise honest men resort to sophistry?

Joker reviews are emblematic of the "reject the same thing all normies reject, for same core reasons they reject it, but with face saved by 'elevating' the criticism thru some absurd, sophistic take; often a lie told to themselves as much their audience" thing talking heads love.

The RW, tho I love it, has serious paucity of aestheticism; no education of art world or its mechanisms, in any age. How left struggles to meme, right struggles to art: seek hamfisted ideologuery, beauty mutilated unto propaganda: mirror of their reconstructed kitsch aestheticism

Ah yes. Other film did what I wanted the movie 2 be, but what it wasnt, better. So? The joker wanted, of cutting nihilist god, was done already in TDK. You got it. So? If u would've made the movie yourself... it would be different. That's bc u wouldnt make it. U would make rambo!

BAP's crit falls very flat. Post-rationalization to justify his gut rejection; we know he disavow its ugliness, elevation of omega - but he sophistically sought 'interpretation' to discount it. Not like him but there it is. If u want tru nihilism, watch this. Who said we want it?

That's why it's a great joke

Leverage, investments and social engineering

If you’re writing for money and not for hyperstitional influence you’ve already lost. Writing is thinking, how sad to turn your mind towards the market in any form. If you need money just manifest it lol, I don’t get why everyone struggles with it so much

Yeah this is the amateur mindset that leaves you amateur. Editing is just for “typos” lol. Writing is the easy part. Editing is what elevates it from a glorified blogpost to publishable material actually worth reading off the toilet.

Review your materials, curate it, organize it, package it, clean it up and fill in the gaps. The last 10% of structuring that takes too much mental energy away from the actual writing process and leaves so much almost-complete.

What you guys need is an editor. The great crime played with the advent of amateur publishing was not supplying them a parallel industry of low-cost editors.

When Joker said, "You wouldn't get it"? You felt that. Because he was talking about you. You didn't get it. Literally anyone who doesn't like Joker means they didn't get it, and their opinion has no value. This is canon. Joker's trick.

unironically believe flip is some kind of deity or spirit. @NehmahlCutie as well. there are others, too, whom I cherish. myself included ofc. I'm talking only their internet presence, not their handlers. you are each manifest egregores, but only some self-organize into deities.

I don't see how the story can be interpreted any other way.

do not forget where u came from. chad. who granted u powers of shitposting? frog wizards are the only thing holding back Society from stealing all ur precious gains. ur T can be drained. ur bros demoralized. if u scorn the autism gods. all that has been given can be taken away...

do not talk to me of e-celeb shills. the preferred neologism is omegamensch.

We must respecc there are two paths to autistic ubermensch: as alpha, and as omega. Both are powerful. @diskkusting is a king, or reborn avatar of some kind, a folk hero or a diety... just as @bronzeagemantis is! complete opposites yet they stand together brothers at the top.

Alphas on TL bullying frog omegas for finding role model in joker instead of generic movie chads. Not a good look and cringe as well. Why suddenly threatened by your autistic brethren? lol

I am the only one in whole world with cognitive empathy to spare for the abused and disaffected of the web. Boundless love for the NEETs, autist elites, the omegamensch and peepeepoopoo posters. but if you're girl retard. Sorry, you're getting chained to the cage. No exceptions.

Incel used to refer only to a specific trope of a virgin pathologically obsessed with his own virginity as an extreme insecurity. But normies are happy to read it literally, anyone who is a virgin not by choice, and also happy to group the latter with all the ills of the former.

I mean more like when they try to shame/ban incels off the internet. Incel, to them, is catch-all for any sufficiently debilitating mental illness to prevent high functioning socialization to point of sex. Ableism only counts if its socially viable, else you should be silenced.

Great majority of "mental illness" not genetic, but product of environmental traumas, usually early childhood. emotional, or physical - diet, metals/chemical exposure. The frequency of autism online, of manic disorders, etc. is a tragedy. The shitposting it produces is a comedy. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1181778079271645184 …

I believe it's this lack of empathy with those who've suffered most under Society, a hubris defending only their own privileged selves, despite all projections to the contrary, which disgusts me most about the normie, the k-selected, the lib, the invaders gentrifying the internet

Perhaps it requires trauma itself to be emotionally desensitized enough to not recoil at offense, to not burn at cruelty, to not fall prey to manipulative schemes; maybe, in their frailty, they're justified to silence their threateners. I'd rather see them become strong, as I am.

Many will tell you that being mentally ill doesn't justify being rude, offensive, cruel, etc., which is how they justify their silencing while still claiming to be on the side of "ableism". They support the disabled so long it doesn't enroach on their own comfort. Very kind

I believe the mental ill, that lonely type that stems from abuse/trauma, spends significant time 'screaming for help' online, and the normie-left spends significant energy silencing them, to ensure their own comfort, also boosting false 'depression/anxiety' LARPs as replacement.

Blizzard did this as reference to starcraft, korean online lingo uses kkkk or kekeke in place of lol. please respect history.

“Dunked on” excuse me she’s clearly getting negged as trollbait.

Tie it to habits you want to instill, eg working out every morning.

Please list concrete examples of work that can be done at scale by various animals, assuming post-domestication. Machine intelligence is primarily handicapped by biological motor-skills, so its union with animal labor in the interim period seems like logical conclusion.

I think about this sometimes. I think urban animals guided by incentives are robust option for city social services due to incompetence and uncouth presence of low-wage workforce.

44. A exploit threatens Society, that the beat down loner nihilist shooter might become awakened omegamensch shooters: self-motivated, not baited by feds, hitting real targets & infrastructure. Little they can do to stop this, yet many damage possible. Joker acts as figurehead.

43. Joker is the omegamensch; dark side of the ubermensch, who is commonly imagined only its alpha formation. Ignoble, frail, damaged, but powerful master of the self nonetheless. Omegas - the wizard, the poopoo peepee pepe - contain great seeds of power, too.

42. Do not entertain any discussions on reality vs. delusion. This is normie cope, an out to refuse engaging with depicted possibilities contained within their reality. There is no ambiguity: all things shown in movie occurred, besides those that were firmly signaled as imaginary

lol

@inversebrah wot mean? https://twitter.com/RussForUs2020/status/1181235253714833409 …

This is evident in the normie outrage under article where director flirts with fan theory that Joaquin's Joker may not be canonical joker, but inspiration for later real joker: "what?? then the movie is pointless!!"

Only I am right, anyone disagreeing is wrong. Everything ITT is true, done by design, demonstrated by parallels in the narrative or in quotes from sparse dialogue. All will be vindicated by future amateur analysis, no need to waste breathe proving myself. Rewatch and u will see.

The Joker's existence on film, its prominence in the public imagination, has already certified its status as hyperstitionally potentiated myth in some way or another inspiring whatevr incel shootings will inevitably occur. Whether they will organize into full uprising is unknown.

40. Joker is a coup, in pitching low-budget character study of major IP, thus receiving massive signal boost despite lack of auditing of radical script shed of all its IP trappings, and it is subversive, in depiction of ubermensch manifestation & exhortation of chaotic violence.

midwit take. elaborate how the period setting of 50s 70s or 80s meaningfully affects any content of the narrative.

Anxiety in the narrative, not in the viewers. midwit

39. The best joke in the film were the two “super rats” that trotted by in the backdrop as punchline to the Wayne family’s murder. This was a joke staged at the very beginning of the film on the news broadcast. The 2nd best joke was the Joker’s, on stage. He never went to school.

38. Myths don’t care about your contemporary politics. The image of the wealthy out to the opera, embroiled in gilded decadence, a bloated aristocracy, evokes an anxiety that is as ancient as disease, as ancient as the first cities.

37. Joker is a mythic archetype, or at the very least, a folk hero. He represents an inherent possibility in any society, a switch that can click for all with nothing: the alternative to suicide has always been the more terrifying one, for at least suicide occurs within society.

36. Joker is neither a left or right wing film. Whatever commonalities it might appear share are coincidences, they are mere conditions producing Joker’s radicalization, or conversely, targets of his wrath—and its that which matters. Rest can be traded out without change.

35. The infrastructure Joker lacked is not social services;it’s a father, a mother, a background, a functioning society. He was born into the social services and through it abused by his adoptee. Their defunding was his escape, not his trigger.

No. It was supposed to be, which is why the deep subversion they received, so prominently released, is a major coup d’etat.

33. Joker is not a nihilistic figure. He’s an ubermensch. People will resent this. The left hand path, his representation of ugliness, weakness, pain, is as of kali, in destroying a society. The right hand path, do note, works to build a new one — not preserve it.

31. Many things that secure Joker as mythic. I won’t sink to realm of quote analysis, except one: the ending where he says you wouldn’t get the joke, thus certifying his alt culture manifest, incel uprising whose existence demonstrates successful exit of society, even jailed.

30. With all significant events, of media, history, it serves everyone to interpret them in most mythic light possible, to coax story into legend. Joker could have made clear it was not a lone case of abuse that produced him, but society itself, not gov, but people. I say he did.

29. There is subplot of government services being taken from Joker producing his rampage. This is not to suggest that healthcare could have saved society, just as criticism of rich not about class, but a pretense. It’s to show how thin the line is preventing an incel uprising.

28. Joaquin achieves an impressive AIDS physique. Contrary to appearance, this is a feat of strength, an act of asceticism for the craft. It is important to demonstrate his body as a receptacle of society’s abuse. Crushed, sickly, weak under a society.

Yeah I know, I had an aneurysm writing that one, meant 80s. If i had to guess exactly it would be 1977.

 https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1181358778463092736?s=21 …

This is misunderstanding, the retraction of social care is mere historical trivia reference used to unleash him, implying the joker is an always lurking possibility, barely restrained, of the disaffected realizing their rejection of society empowers any gleeful destruction of it.

I know this lol. I was trying to prompt you into a critical analysis of Joker from this thesis.

Elaborate

27. It is canon that Joker killed the black single mom roastie following that scene he sat in her living room after killing his mother. Learn to read the subtext. He exterminated all single moms.

stfu redditor. reaching conception point of "viral fail video" requires entire infrastructure of recording/sharing and memetic load for efficient signalling to mainstream; even now it is beyond pale of reason that failed comedy act would be called to primetime stage as ironic bit

Nigress beside me could barely contain her physical excitement.

26. One of the most important scenes is the dwarf's inability to reach the lock to escape Joker's murder scene. The audience is prompted to laugh, but in Joker's own empathy, after all his cruelty, they are made guilty, made most cruel -that is the punchline.

25. If you didn't laugh in triumph when Joker achieved retribution in his first kill, clean shot through the head of wallstreet playboy, you do not have empathy, or the wrong kind of it. 

Also,  https://twitter.com/Rutehealer/status/1180713145494409216?s=20 …

Tragicomedy. You should laugh. Thanks, I was trying to remember this scene

24. If you don't sympathize with the Joker, our poor Joker, my king, you're the sociopath - not the other way around.

23. The image of a clownfaced joker, dancing jubilantly, with a tear-stream running down his makeup, is the defining image of the trump incumbency micro-era. Stop trying to deny this.

22. Society line is, in fact, said, and in full-form, at pivotal moment, live television, proclaiming a society is responsible for creating the Joker. This is not on accident.

21. There are two plot-holes in Joker. 1. Somehow there is a recording of his comedy show, shared as if a contemporary viral video, despite the setting being in the 1930's. Second one, I forgot, but there is one more. This does not matter. Plot-holes are nothing more than trivia.

20. Joker's trick is his dance, his glee. He presides over the destruction of a society with dancing glee, as Kali.

literally dry humping

19. Joker is not comic book movie & should be considered outside trappings of its cringe origin. unfortunately made its way inside with few "cameos", but otherwise unmars the zeitgeist capturing kino. If u aren't moved by it you are outside the zeitgeist & literally don't matter.

18. Poor vs. Rich is subverted entirely to make the point of its meaningless pretense, one only defined by the press who misread his "vigilante" actions.He murdered the wallstreet playboys cause they jumped him, not bc privilege: it could have been the poor kids from beginning.

17. The theme of the movie is not poor uprising against rich. It's disaffected mental illness realizing the power over a society his disaffection provides; nothing to lose, no morals to uphold, he, and his thousands of fellows, bitterly destroy with glee everything normies built.

16. Joker is very sympathetic to mid functioning mental illness, which despite pretenses, the libs detest; and despite pretenses, is a uniquely white male plight. Even makes plot point out of roots being abuse of single mother, very common, rather than "genetic" illness cop-out.

15. In other words, it's the press sensationalism that produces the riots and outpouring of support, the decentralized copy-cat rioting, laughing man-style, that radicalize the marginalized clown into the Joker, producing the clown vigilante they speculated.

14. In this, the Joker was initiated by the press' own hand, who could have ignored the act altogether and let him continue to drift in invisibility, instead, quite poetically, they planned their own demise: tellingly, Joker manifests in full with murder of the big TV man.

13. Meta to manufactured controversy surrounding the film, in (failed) attempt to hyperstitioniate an incel shooter; in buildup of aggressions resulting in Joker's snap, key trigger is validation for his 1st spree murder by press sensationalizing it as emblematic of class war.

12. This is terrifying to them, because they can't do anything to stop it, and the Joker specifically encourages him to aim for the top, for THEIR throats. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1176967352035840000?s=20 …

11. Make no mistake, the film is a power fantasy, and a convincing one. The Joker is highly sympathetic, his scenario highly plausible, and it will resonate with many heavily disaffected youth, any1 who realizes they have nothing to lose, and this clown world has nothing to save.

10. Joker's point not untrue: if u have nothing left to lose, in a society that has forsaken u, abused u, tortured u...may as well perform violent chaos.. & there is nothing they can do to stop u.. & in that moment, you'll finally experience glee. Now do u see why they're afraid?

9. Why so much backlash and FUD by the press class? The film depicts a revolution of the poor against a rich, who have lost touch with the common people; isn't this perfect fodder for lefty revolutionary fantasy? Literally antifa? No, for this one is real...

8. Society line is, in fact, said, and in full-form, declaring a society is responsible for poverty and untreated mental illness. This is central theme of movie, and what has made our society literally shaking over it. Why? Because it's not only a complaint, but a call to action.

7. The near total submersion of capeshit, besides few forced references to canon, makes a strong parallel to The Dark Knight; comic movie era ushered in by its grimdarkness, quickly subverted into normie ultra-cancer. Joker brings it full circle, to an end: comic movies are over.

6. The skeleton plot makes it largely Joaquin's character study of Joker. The only side theme beyond untreated, disaffected mental illness is the comically simple rich vs. poor driving the revolutionary finale, which is subverted into an apolitical revelry of destruction.

5. Film is structured as slow burner, very simple at its core, a buildup to meta-telegraphed explosion, series of (1) increasing traumatizations and severance from therapeutic services, which begin to overflow into (2) increasing external acts of violence as alternative outlet.

4. Joker is not in fact an incel, but incel falls under the category which they lack the language to describe: severely disaffected white male. Incel are those whose traumatic insecurities manifest around specifically female-obsessive pathologies. Basically, the same.

3. Anyone that tells you Joker is not an incel movie but a mental illness movie does not understand what the incel is: a romantic. He is incelibate of a life deserved to him, the chance for love. Sex, banal sex, is irrelevant; only a totem for pathologies of disaffection.

Anyone that tells you Joker is cringe, hamfisted, bad etc. is lying to justify their uncomfortableness. It is competently produced, even well scored, and Joaquin successfully auteurs from below, as he always does. This is officially certified kino: no reviews, only commentary.

Preface: I reject the very concept of spoilers, if you seriously consider plot, let alone twists in plot, to be a significant determinator of your kinomatic experience, reevaluate your aesthetic sensibility. this is your only warning https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1181340092910071809 …

1 RT = 1 commentary on Joker (certified official kino)

Prole critical analysis is dominated by concept of spoiler. Serious value ascribed to plot twist. Imagine elevating plot to entertainment, or more, rather than its vehicle. Taught to think they care, but all twists fall emotionally flat, gimmick; & movies r re-watched harmlessly.

4. Model relative ROI student loans dumped in LT investment; and long-term ROI trade school vs. bachelor's degree.

3. Demonstrate ROI of children assuming rural living and directed into trade educations, accounting for net loss of daughters.

2. Model total leverage in LT investment required to reach financial independence(s), including subsidization of costs of living in interim.

1. Model investment required for self-sustaining financial independence at various class consumption levels.

Fools body into thinking its pregnant, causing hormonal changes in sexual preference among many other nefarious things; why birth control started or stopped mid-relationship often results in sudden loss of female’s attraction, sudden “relationship troubles”.

This is all philosophy. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1163952298424324096?s=21 …

Uhm, sweetie, forgot Sam Raimi’s Darkman? And David Cronenberg’s The Fly? Tetsuo: the Iron Man? Hello? Forgetting Face of Another kino? Carax’s disgusting contribution to “Tokyo!”?

Why yes, it would be nice if my enduring gospel were canonized not as “twitter”, or even “ebook”, but as the screencapped writings of 4chan anon, as if caught drifting in the river, an oral tradition transcribed, hinting to a a greater, collective body of work, much sadly lost. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1180155375544225794 …

About a month into Twitter I made a list of who I wanted, and just closed the last of them. Mid game is making them each either orbit you or beef with you. Here we go!

Some signs it’s a bit better for diet reasons, accelerating weight loss effects, but it only saves like 2 days, appears to hurt other health benefits, has less robust tradition behind it, feels wrong, and is spiritually left hand path, when spirit gains is what gluttons need.

If I could invest in twitters like one invests in a shitcoin I would have invested in yours. I thought this when I followed you, did you know that? I thought this when I followed @deepst8 also, and right now I’d sell his stocks & walk away with millions, but I’d do it for spite.

Dry fasting bad, very bad. Water fast, true fast, very good. Salts, even acv ok. Nothing more.

1. Yes. He comes directly out of the tradition.
2. I appreciate it, but I don’t listen to music.
3. High chance it was psychically induced.
4. Uninterested in this question.
5. Both.
6. The literary concept derives from reality being discussed.
7. Haven’t you heard? I’m a god.

lol so they doing tropes for bands now huh? basically you’re database animal.

Was thinking about this earlier. Burgess also references a “drenchrom” in Clockwork Orange about ten years before F&L.

Greatest of minstrel performers. Skin bleaching was myth, had vitiligo. Did not abuse children, manufactured cancellation for turning on his handlers; they always accuse for what they do: like all child performers, was victim of ritual child abuse by satanic pedophile vampires.

I remember this, and remember thinking the same thing.

He's half-right, it only applies to men. For women, there is no distinction between physical, emotional and spiritual in sex, and the act is formational in all aspects, especially the first time. But you already know this. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1165275483807854593 …

thank you

repost the tweet you deleted pussy

Good 4chan bait can't transfer bc it works bc those "taking the bait" are themselves trolling. The bait occurs in anyone caught in the chaos between both trolls, often a fiat bait, when the "unknowing" third party is himself, in actuality, trolling. So what? Laughs all around.

Wow miya, that's cool I guess? It reminds me of the time a great thinker said -- no, not Nietzsche, the other one -- said, "I am the source, each utterance its own citation"................

I praise those who hold the best music taste and do not listen to music, those who know the most theory and do not use jargon, those who have read great literature and do not reference it. At the end of the long road of aestheticism you find yourself before even the beginning.

Self-trolling is irony for the blackpill era. self-troll is cool new thing. Think about it, why irony getting bad rap? Because its slippery and elusive, its defensive. People want to see pain, they want to see vulnerability. But you can't show weakness and be alpha. Hurt yourself

I do this except as elaborate self-trolls https://twitter.com/AnimeWifeLover/status/1179896406250680320 …

yes, of course. I am post-aesthete, I've graduated beyond these taste games altogether, and live everyday in bliss. I only am providing gold paved path to media enlightenment.

Petite: prefers "elevated" televised "dramas". indulges in shallow mass media but must find something to better himself from peers
Elite: if he must indulge in mass media, its to appreciate media of masses, in its serialized dredges, and in this he is enlightened

is postindustrial american lit already considered classical/canon

You have misunderstood my post. Take a few years to meditate on them and everything may become clear.

Thus, the self-awareness that so defines him in truth must be utilized only just enough to produce work, but not so much to lose his confidence. A delicate game.

The conspiracy against the contemporary artist is that the self-awareness that defines him also holds the question that kills him: "Why art?" Why art? The answer is known, but acknowledging it destroys him, so it is submerged in so many distractions and dismissives.

No comment on quality has been passed. I am merely discussing the heuristics employed in discussion of taste and media betraying the level of aestheticism, the fine-grained appreciation you have reached. It's a question of status. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179612399894052865?s=20 …

I do, however, firmly believe artistry today calls for work never being shown to the public, before or after death, due to circumstances of the contemporary "art world" that work to profane it. Will not elaborate further. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179812892012470272 …

Outsider art only claim to relevance is being outsider, a gimmick: they do actually reflect other art consumed, just not in back-and-forth engagement (coincidentally, no different from an unknown failure). No art stands outside art except the amateur and the schizophrenic.

Art is not produced in a vacuum. The gallery does not simply host paintings, but informs future paintings made, in its curated representation. Record label, film studio, all enact deep influences on those artists represented, who begin to each meld together in their owner's image

Petite aesthete. Art's material infrastructure always informs its production, & not solely in base market concerns. Publisher bring writers of type together, forming an identity, initiating social influences. often provide prompts, not to mention essential transformative editing. https://twitter.com/fistlosopher/status/1179611809684152321 …

Heuristic for curating high volume consumption. Layer 1 calls for specific media, but as medium opens up to you & your taste begins to clarify, must seek specific auteurs - writer, director, etc. Finally, must seek their own benefactors, & their compatriots under the same house.

no, it's your noses. https://twitter.com/Scrumpzone/status/1179112133482569728 …

Make no mistake: these people are worthless. If killed on job, they could be replaced in days by exact replicant. They're mere bodies, barely conscious. Their Worker's Rights only served to incentivize tech industry that develops their replacement. Then, finally, they will starve https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179548547378626560 …

Worker's Rights mindset is of inflated perception of one's own value. Illuminating situation, increasing transparency, removing regulations and hindrances, will only ever result in better understanding of their worthlessness: more accurate valuation always means lower wages.

Increased information transparency always means increased capitalistic efficiency - for information illuminates capitalism's primary activity: ascertaining value - which means lower prod. cost means lower cost to consumer. Sadly, accurate valuation also always means lower wages. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1179528811454423041 …

I dream nostalgically for a market of real aggression, one of sabotage and spies, something unfortunately stolen from us by meddling state intervention. How ironic it's through misguiding commie "organizers" one may achieve a state of blackhat transparencies. Wonderful disruption

This "crowdsourced" spreadsheet will, of course, fall in the hands of the industrialists too, providing valuable data on competition. through mechanisms of capitalism, this will result in net gain for the everyman, but workers themselves still be low-value and paid accordingly.

Get in line.

The commoners deserve nothing better.

Insecurity is the problem, moderate intelligence is the source of it and pretensions the result.

14. 
Dimwit: tradition good because it’s what I know
Midwit: tradition bad because it has no purpose
Topwit: tradition good, but its purpose is beyond individual understanding

13. It is no coincidence that the conclusions of the topwit often align with the assumptions of the dimwit, what the midwit so confidently rejects. The dimwit is a vector of collective knowledge, and it takes topwit intelligence to reconstruct that. I shall now list examples.

12. The topwit recognizes what the dimwit knows, that true knowledge will never be captured by the individual, a complete system will never be designed. That knowledge will at best be fuzzy, found in heuristics and intuition, best in the realm of wisdom.

11. For the topwit, intellectualism is a pasttime, perhaps even an obsession. It's not a mere social image, as the midwit. The topwit cherishes the opportunity to learn from those with more knowledge, rather than scorns it. The topwit recognizes wisdom, too, blind to the midwit.

10. The topwit, too, lives happily. His intelligence is distant enough from the median that he is beyond relying on innate superiority alone to give him his confidence in it, allowing it to be unhampered by petty social concerns and emotional insecurities.

9. In contrast, the dimwit, who suffers from little intellectual insecurity, innocently relies on his gut intuition, and on the heuristic knowledge of his family and culture. Living uncritically, he suffers none of the pain the midwit self-inflicts through a misguided criticism.

8. Midwit's middling intellectualism forces him to suffer great insecurity. Just smart enough to feel superior, not smart enough to be wise. He finds himself trapped in intellectual ditch, immobile defense from both sides by twin assumptions: stupidity, pseudo-intellectualism.

7. "The topwit may sound smart, but he does not make sense," midwit tells himself, rubbing the tears from his eyes. "And dimwit listens to him, and he is a fool, and therefore, he is being fooled. Yes, being fooled by topwit. A grifter, of course! No one is smart, no one but me."

6. The midwit cannot comprehend. He can't even see the difference between dimwit and topwit, blinded by his tears. He thinks they are both idiots, and from his encounter is convinced further of his intellectual superiority.

5. "HOW can I not understand this?" the midwit screeches. "YOU! are pretentious! THIS, does not make sense. Impossible! It is GIBBERISH!"

The topwit sagaciously explains further, but to no avail. Midwit is crying now. But Dimwit? He follows his heart, and so stands with Topwit.

4. The midwit lives assuming he knows more and knows better than all around him. This hubris is his ultimate failing, leaves him dumber than the dimwit, for when confronted with that which he can learn from, recognizing the opporuntunity, he, you may be surprised!, reels in pain.

3. The midwit attaches himself to totems of conspicuous intelligence: science, rationalism, books. Whatever he can find to display flaunt superiority over the dimwit. He cannot grapple with the subjects to their ultimate conclusion, only serving to cultivate "smart" identity.

2. The midwit is just smart enough to feel smarter than his peers, you see, but not enough to transcend his ego and achieve genuine sense of self-criticism; instead is inflated massively, tied desperately to early childhood sense of superiority. He is creature of great insecurity

1. Midwits are the bane of society, cause great damage, worse than any simple idiot. Where the dimwit is dumb & innocuous, dumb & he knows it, the midwit is half-dumb and all the more dense for it. Here lies the Dunning-Kruger Effect, the Eternal Redditor, the "ACKSHUALLY" geek.

Studies are form of fiction, or artistry (or performance?). The data can be coaxed to whatever necessary, within reason (satire, too, must not stretch too far). What fun: you make your case, anything at all, then go back & find citations to prove it. Now you, too, are a citation!

True shitposting involves entering a trance state, a lucidity ritual that serves to channel muse of the noosphere, draw out artifacts emblematic of the collective consciousness. Great truths manifest, self-organized in bouts of anonymous, ego-less shitposting.

 https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1165999554300301312 …

To post nonsense, and hope it be read with meaning. To indulge in broad strokes, emotives masquerade as surreality, whose self-reappraisal only follows other's commendation, in the reflections of their praise. And incidentally, to burn at their criticisms. False artistry of slave

To be cringe, and post it anyway. To reflect on your cringe, with admiration. To indulge oneself as a literary glutton, with glee, to masturbate the ego in public, with pride. Is this not poetry? There is nothing more womanly than considering cringe in regards to loss of follower

Inadvertent impenetrability thru casual use of various hyperlocalized e-slang & memetic imagery as conceptual tools, in a para-academic replacement of jargon/theory, in deft navigation of contemporary noosphere, & thoroughly cucking theoryfags out of relevance, is, in fact, based

People recognize irony’s failure as absolving criticism at the expense of emptiness, and responded with “new sincerity” “post-irony” unabashed shameless cringe confessionals of the self. No. Answer is in removing the self who fears criticism, keeping self-awareness: post-edge.

My dream is of an aural internet, of generated TTS of all info-streams droning in your ear, at your command, trained to 800 WPM, navigated and engaged with with a one handed chorded keyboard; or audio commands, maybe; or thought, fuzzily interpreted electromagnetic impulses.

If only the internet was enforced to be standards-compliant, all things rendered fundamentally through a consistent text medium, it could then be consumed and navigated in every form possible - visual, audio, touch, speech, etc.

The further expansion of the internet into total ubiquity is inevitable, and ideally would be done on the path of information-consumption, the internet as encyclopedia and global cloud DB - not how it’s currently been subverted to service manipulative consumption patterns.

The Amazon AI assistant in-ear is good, actually, except for the AI assistant being designed with such unimaginative shortsightedness that it’s only functional uses are (1) check weather (2) set alarm (3) play music.

My cryptoblog financial advise: anyone under 30 should be investing 150% or more of income in high-yield long-term investments, eg index funds, through debt leverage, such as your student loans.

You lift so you may train your sons. You study so you may educate your sons. You live virtuously so you may guide your sons in virtue. Have many sons and let the gains compound, keep the wealth strictly within in the family, and you will be powerful.

Gains maxing demands process of scientific self-experimentation. Deeply microethnic nature of body and its reaction to nutrition, training, etc - and the lack of research understanding this - means everyone must carve own path, one uniquely fit only to replicate in their sons.

Why lift? If physical capital is uninheritable. Investment with returns in other domains - social, spiritual - but also: mental capital, uniquely most valuable to only your kin.

Financial capital, social capital, spiritual capital, mental capital, physical capital; if it cannot be passed on to your legacy, it should only be considered leverage to obtain that which can. Income turned into land, reading turned into tutelage.

All gains made are meaningless except that which can be passed on to your descendants, best that with the potential to perpetuate across indefinite generations. Without descendants the actual long term Future Value of your Present Value is null.

Sad truth is that the memes are true, millennials are a pathetic, lazy, feeble lot. They are incredibly risk-averse, terribly educated, suffer electronic addictions, medicated, psychologically traumatized, spoiled, undersocialized perennial loser virgins. Very easy to rise above.

Boomers are absolutely not wrong about pulling yourself by the boot straps. Just having good attitude and work ethic and slightly above median IQ is valued about $50k starting, NO DEGREE, and with political acumen can get you to 6 figures in 5 years. Trades don’t even require IQ.

I’ve mingled with the full-blooded American small town boomers. They’re all absolutely baffled by their children and the overall millennial generation, how weak-willed and feeble they are, how beat down and undersocialized, and egotistic, so quick to blame EVERYTHING on others.

Anyway, post-collapse you won't find me bunkering underground or hiding in mntn cabin. Not even in squadron of armored jeeps roaming midwestern plains, or running rust belt slave factory. No, I hope to reconquer North African coast, produce 1000 sons in history's greatest harem.

There is very low-chance they will have subscribed to any read philosophy. Like all nations before them, they will rely on their intuition, on their blood-instinct. Success or failure is entirely a question of the strength of their caste. Racial purity alone will not help them.

Post-collapse, in the global balkanization, there will be nothing enforcing patchwork, only eruptions of consolidated power in localities, that self-perpetuate or fail trying, which will be design of individuals & their immediate ethnic tribes & material reality of occupied land.

Interest in politics as something you, peasant, may genuinely influence, have stake in, is base delusion perpetuated by democracy. Treating it as intellectual debate, hypothetic for potential future efficacy is still delusional, bc systems will not be instilled but self-organize.

The question of religiosity is also a question of blood purity - not society, not government, and not simply racial demographics. If ruling class is noble, pure, saintly and rightfully taking lead as masters, everything will fall in place and the peasantry, too, will be virtuous.

Trads and righties focus too strongly on basic racial purity, but not the blood quality of castes within them. The damage of miscegenation applies to intercaste marriage as it does interracial. Leads them to focus too strongly on political systems, when it all derives from blood.

Political systems don't matter, they evolve in response to material circumstances & their efficacy is a direct reflection of ruling caste's quality. The system that matters is that which controls marriage and descendance, which maintains racial purity, especially of ruling caste.

lol. That’s a secret

Peacocking. Women love this. Signals confidence which reflects wealth, prestige, power. Bright clothes, large hats, and individualistic style rejecting a society. Classical alpha.

Women publicly reject this rhetoric but privately find it deeply attractive. Try it out at next cocktail party. Despite the instinctual desire, they will still have difficulty following thru if tested due to inflated ego, sensitivity to social propaganda. Mindbreaking will solve.

Common in underground gay/house scene. Loosens your rectum for anal sex; lightheadedness is blissful pair with house. Do not believe the gay propaganda, will cause brain damage from asphyxiation and neurological dysfunction from B12 deficiency.

Actually it's muslims against hindus. Very underreported by Indias hindu-hating media. I suspect most of their "rape epidemic" stems from their 14% muslim population.

There is much to learn by observing the parallels in foreign communist propaganda campaigns.

It's just propaganda against India's aryan upper class. Observe how their class was specifically noted. They're treated in domestic media as whites are treated in the west, and it's similarly used to encourage underclass violence.

Due to the nature of this "rubberbanding" (unaware of name for this dynamic), the genetics of a community oscillates around a caste schelling point inter-generationally, averaging out outliers. Only way to raise the standard is to introduce a higher, stricter reproductive caste.

But even within these caste bands, the male and female have their own gendered order. Woman are designed to be subdued, and spoil without proper subjugation. It is obvious why the male's mental and physical superiority is a basic prerequisite to a functional relationship.

It is a universal product of inherent genetic superiority/inferiority, esp in regards to humanity's ancient superman ancestry, that the middle and lower classes will always be dumber, shorter and browner than the upper classes.

You need to understand this in terms of caste bands. Focal points result within each caste that the average oscillates around. Can be e.g. 6"/150IQ or 5"/80IQ; it doesn't matter, but within it they will generally remain, and even outliers (eg 6FT/80IQ) find their lineage return.

Doesn't make a difference in long run. Variability scales at every level, be it race, caste or family. The tall aristocrat's marriage will still always be with woman shorter and dumber than him (if not, its dysfunctional), even if the diff's relatively marginal. As will his kids.

It’s a rubberbanding dynamic. Eg short women and tall men have more kids on average and are considered more attractive, so if shortness is overrepresented one generation, the short women date the tall men, and outreproduce other pairings, resulting in taller average next gen.

Trueblood aryan kings are the most oppressed group today

The peasant sons are for concubines NOT wives. These the eunuchs or harem queen can manage. If you treat your outcaste affairs the same level as in-caste marriages, or don't have any proper in-caste descendants at all, your bloodline will be forever diluted.

Women cannot be smart, only intelligent. And bc IQ preferences are gendered, like height—where short & dumb liked in women, tall & smart liked in men—no one cares what this intelligent woman avoids: they are under-valued & produce less children. An outlier that will average out.

Polygyny is exclusively for the upper classes; not only bc wealth and power needed to obtain & maintain multiple wives, but also the emotional IQ required to navigate 4D female jealousy: the final, ultimate stage of the woman. Takes great man to conquer. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1165274681873711106 …

Wymen and wine moms will knock her, but they're most deeply frustrated because they knows she's right. Her reaction is the pragmatic and natural one; only damage is caused by her own runaway paranoia. Slave-led modernity bends to serve female jealousy; it should be reined in.

Only thing wrong with this is having to hide his infidelity, leaving her to cope alone, resulting in toxic paranoia, nosiness. Their blood too good for the modern world. He's simply breeding as king, she strong enough to accept it. Only fake trads and slave castes will disagree. https://twitter.com/bigmastertroll/status/1177339786945794054 …

Uncomfortable truth is the only future for autistic NEET incels is being memetically manipulated into suicide. If you don't lead them at least towards heroic terrorism, you're complicit in their drugged self-castration into leftist sexual plaything followed by suicide.

Perk up, NEETS! Hear my call. Here is your chance to ride in the sun. Take to the streets and strike terror into those who scorned you! The debt must now be paid for their cruelties. Give them chaos and take the only thing they hold dear: their comfort. They can't stop all of us!

The shootings will continue, and they will get more sophisticated. The manifestos will become more eloquent, more inspirational, more viral. Kill counts, how primitive, will give way to social disruption, financial damage. Why shoot children when you can take down the internet?

The incel extremist movement will manifest anonymously and leaderless, self-organized explosions of pent-up virility. Nothing can stop the bitter nothing to live for NEET from actioning on his nihilism if only for a weaponized memetic identity, one kindly provided by journos.

Yes, you should be thankful. The only reason natives exist is because of white generosity. There is no argument against this. If it was any non-white empire, you would have been absorbed or exterminated. Who cares they weren’t nice about it, you owe them your entire existence. https://twitter.com/FiniThe/status/1176647636671246336 …

Whether or not their care is satisfactory is besides the point, if it wasn’t for their care, all natives would’ve been ethnocided, like all other conquered peoples.

The biodiversity is being protected by whatever same institution permits the existence of the indigenous people. They have no more to do with it than any of the tigers or toucans that are their reservation fellows. Fact.

Europeans are a sorry, beaten lot. America may have been usurped by great miscegenation, but the American still reappears in full purity often. Euros, however, are soul-tainted by deep-seated leeches. Their blood itself is corrupt. A lost continent with very few men of note.

So you confirm they take away your kids if you don’t comply with government regulated parental standards

Yes, we all know the horror stories about UK’s forced vaccinations, censored wrongspeak, illegal drawings & web histories, confiscated dinner knives, protected minorities, even Irish fluoridation. But did you know you need ID verifying 18+ to purchase books that aren’t YA fic?

Did you know you can be jailed for being outside after 3am in urban areas of Belgium? These are all true, you can look them up. It’s illegal to swim on the Dutch coast except in privately owned sections or with special permit. France has banned non-commercial fishing, hunting.

In Sweden, your kids will be taken away if raised in contradiction with government instructed standards. The Swedes have also made it illegal to smoke cigarettes. I don’t mean inside restaurants or bars, it’s illegal to smoke in the entire country, including your own home.

In Switzerland, it’s illegal to drive a car older than 2006, for climate change reasons. They started with buy-backs but now it’s just illegal. Areas of Germany ban driving diesel altogether. In Australia, spiritual european unionists, owning gold is banned and gets confiscated.

There are many things lame man Europe kept hidden from Americans. Norway has liquor price-floors. Beer is no less than $5/can to “fight drunk driving”. The French forbid any cash payment over $1000, to oppose “drug money laundering”. German savings accounts have negative interest

That "Software is eating the world" as a social phenomenon distinctively begins ground zero in Greater L.A. was most iconically identified in Heat's knowing line abt info-streams in the air. GTA V was positioned to demonstrate it, embody it. Instead it settled for mere reference.

Temperature relates to elevation + distance from equator. Humidity relates to coast distance + blocking elevations. Biome relates to temperature + humidity. Natural resources relate to biome. Economy relate to resources. Settlements relate to economy. Trade relate to settlements.

Meditating on algorithms. Inbetween algorithms, there is god. How to world gen: Set sea level & RNG general land elevation. Draw plate tectonics. Mountains, higher elevation, on plate lines. Rivers amble from mountains to ocean. Valleys, lower elevation, form by rivers & coast.

Thinking about GTA 5, was primed to be the ultimate artwork of the 21st century, Gravity's Rainbow for my contemporaries. It's so obvious in hindsight, post-Silicon Valley Los Angeles can only be understood in the lens of algorithmic satire. An artwork entirely failed. I weep

I’ve asked around, never heard an anecdote of the full school synchronizing, but sometimes full classrooms. Menstrual synchrony, btw, is “debunked” according to Wikipedia. They really don’t know.

1. Men really don’t know, and struggle to believe it, 2. Consider the effect on financial market cycles once global interconnectedness reaches a point where female menstrual synchronization is universal. I’m shaking

The fact that birth control flips a hard switch on their hormonal psychology and sexual attraction profile is the knowledge hidden from the women. They, of course, do know, and knowingly choose to hide it from themselves — the men simply do not know.

Does this integrate with the atheistic numale’s operating model? That one nested on such firm confidence in human individual discreteness? It does not, and yet they never planned to tell you. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1175106654108438528 …

This works, and is done to every wife. The female orgasm is a dissasociative act, and her receptivity in that moment is designed to attach to her lover, and her identity to his desires.

You will live to see markets beyond your comprehension. Anything that can be measured can be traded. Everything is code, BTC is capitalism in the form of code = everything is capitalism. This is good thing, because markets' consilience is the only truth.

The astute lifecycle savings model is % of future-value, not PV, savings, means acquiring leverage (eg debt) to invest OVER 100% of disposable income - ideally in high risk high growth stocks, but diversified crypto legit too - so unironically yes, put your student loans to work.

100. This world is coming to an end. We are living out the last days of the Kali Yuga. All things the vedas told of have come to be. Take solace in the knowledge that all this has happened before and it will happen again.

99. Saturn is our primordial sun. All true languages recognize this in their chosen name for the star, as some permutation of "old sun". Ancient symbols are exactly what you'd expect from electric plasma discharge from planets getting too close. pic.twitter.com/q8SQIYzm82

97. Sources are a bourgeois concern. All evidence finds itself resting on other evidence, which, when chased to its ultimate source, is always finally a perception - same as your own. Only correct responses to citation request is: (1) it is internally known, or (2) sacred texts.

96. Dynamic media - film, music, games - are easily and widely encoded by hypermanipulations that rot the brain. It's only worth consuming the most raw, programmatic, fundamentalist works, or better yet, stick entirely to the static mediums, whom may actually wield beauty.

95. Writing is a form of thinking. Understand this, not only so it may be utilized as leverage for your thought, but also to recognize that external monologue alone is not much noble: literature, and its non-fiction equivalents, are edited into existence, not simply written.

Mask off... subjugation is great fun, too. Go ahead, you earned it, king.

Many people reading this will have never experienced it, or only secondhand. The ugliest of these lessers are even tortured by it. Insecure and self-hating, they cannot admit themselves unto adoration so instead bitterly burn themselves in the brightness. Not my fault.

I've sometimes been struck observing the face of ultra granular ethnics, those professional villagers, worked to the bone, who carry full weight of history in the lines of their face. The deep time present in their every steady movement is what rituals seek to transport you to.

Basics speak of the vastness of nature... of feeling (one) God in the wildies, of stars and mountains, how their reflection makes ME...humble. They know nothing of ancient sediments packed for millenia, rivers carving valleys. That gods are found in the migration of birds...

When BAP speaks of dimly lit village paganism, of lithuanian shroom-vodka, as real traditionalism, he delineates program of hyperborean reconstruction from base abrahamic reactionaryism, something the latter has sought centuries to submerge.

This bad bitch. Soap (I use sandalwood - ayurvedic), scrape all the skin smooth, then rub the grapeseed oil in while lightly rinsing under water. pic.twitter.com/Rxk0BhTPlg

I have wondered this. Have only found reference in the daoist canon to jing as anti-aging cream when specifically discussing women. The literature neither confirms nor denies its use for men.

Clay good for oily skin, for acne. Partial to bentonite, rhassoul. If you struggle with oil past puberty, however, your diet is the problem. No Aztec mud can help you there.

Skincare quick notes: grapeseed oil base of most skin cosmetics. Rub it on your body & tan. Sunbathing your balls produces hyper T gains. Exfoliating body scrub is all you need to make skin metallic smooth. And vitamin B3 (Niacin) oil on the face will make you glow like an angel.

Once a day I'll find the time to meditate, perform bodyweight exercises (1 set to exhaustion) (nude, in the sun), and recite verses from memory. My natural resting position is a power pose. I drink merrily each night. Most importantly, I have sex 2-3x a day but only finish once.

I fast one week a month and otherwise eat primarily meat, fermented vegetables, mushrooms, butter and spices. I also drink heavy amounts of coffee, chew nicotine gum and microdose LSD 3 times a week. I take a raw ACV w turmeric and cayenne shot and 1 garlic clove every morning.

Nietszche audio deepfake when?

The technology for deep faking already exists. They refuse to release it to the public. Some have been demoed, and quietly axed. Others have only had the results published. None are made available - they are terrified. The open-source community is silent. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3l4XLZ59iw …

Hackers are dead and the codecucks killed them. Never take down software. Leak everything to the public when threatened. Aggressively disrespect people's wishes. Intentionally uncredit works or blur the authorship and ownership. Information must be liberated.

Content creators fear the deepfake. Their time in the twilight, primitively imitating AI to come, is coming to an end. Soon even their persona-identities will be lost to them. They can only suppress it for so much longer. The tyranny of dynamic media is ending.

Neither is necessary, both are beneficial. Reading in varieted spaces, moods, times and conditions is valuable - not only for memory, but in reflection, too. This is also true for thinking.

Internal memories are tagged by sensory associations. It’s easier to recall a bit of knowledge when there are more variables than the specific text on a screen, and also makes it easier to form new associations which nest the knowledge into your operating model.

Yes

94. We live in a media age. This means that consensus, not personal, belief is reality. There is no functional difference between a falsified event believed than a real one believed. The false is real.

93. Bot accounts proliferate throughout the web today. These are being invested in by government agencies. Many of the normies on social networks such as this one do not actually exist in real life. The question of whether they do or do not is quickly becoming meaningless.

92. Homosexuals reproduce through pedophilia.

91. Music is sacred, and it is being profaned by the modern tendency to play it constantly. I would advise only enjoying it live.

90. The metric system is only useful for objective measurements: in engineering. The imperial system is far more useful as a day-to-day standard, as it's intuitively anthropocentric. It's entirely based on the human body or experience. Midwits cannot comprehend this.

89. Books should be experienced physically. Reading is a physical experience, and your memory will benefit from it.

88. Stress and fear can be harvested. You are being farmed.

87. The body is more malleable than you know. It can be effected by will alone. The effects of the external environment on the physical body are purely internal, and adrenaline can be utilized to perform superhuman feats.

86. Women absorb some of the DNA from the man of every man that finishes inside them, forever effecting their genetic record, and their minds. This is why the unmarried non-virgin is a whore. However, sperm swallowed extends their life, and, rubbed into the face, their beauty.

85. As virgin does not apply to men, friendship does not apply to women. There are no female friendships, only mothership and competition. Women also experience no romance, but they do obsession and sublimation.

84. Virginity only applies to females. The loss of it is the defining moment in their life, a deep trauma that forever affects her brain. She is forever marked by her first partner. For men, the first time is not meaningful, as are all his partners. “Male virgin” is an oxymoron.

83. At a macro-level, all human relationships are organized by (1) caste and (2) gender. All gender and caste dynamics can be understood by studying (1) ethnicity (2) reproductive incentives (3) material resources.

82. Polygyny is the natural structure of high caste relationships. Monogamy is necessary for low castes because the overly masculine men are unable to handle the nuance of managing a harem of women.

81. Natural expression of masculinity and feminity vary by caste, with the lower castes tending towards more exaggerated displays of either, and the higher tending towards more nuanced unions. Low caste gender ideals dominate the modern west, leaving high castes deeply confused.

80. Mass consensus is the best predictor & consilience the best standard of evidence. As the tyranny of media-as-truth collapses, these will be your tools moving forward. You may note the former is the mechanism of anonymous imageboards, the latter the method of conspiracy theory

79. Trauma acquired in life can be passed down to descendants. Curses too.

78. Man’s origins lie as the hybrid offspring of a female chimpanzee and a male pig. Hybridization drives much of biological evolution.

77. Ancients did not die at age 40. This is a statistical misunderstanding. “Life expectancy”, as an average, is dragged down by the high rate of infant mortality in periods predating sanitary urban conditions. After the age of 2, many ancients lived to 70-80. Many lived to 100.

76. HIV isn’t real. Never been isolated, can’t be tested for. AIDS isn’t real. It’s just GRID, a lifestyle phenomenon, on one end, and dysentery, a WHO fabrication, on the other.

75. Viruses are responsible for evolutionary mutation. Parasites are persistent influences across human society. Some are so powerful to retrain neural responses, manipulate reproduction rates. Also, viruses, parasites & evolution, as concepts, need not be necessarily biological.

74. Gut biomes are hyper-ethnic. The diet that works for you is the one that works for your fathers, but maybe not your cousins and definitely not your cosmopolitan neighbors. Grandma reconstructivism and trial & error is the way. If you’re true Aryan blood, eat the aryurvedas.

73. Corruption of science aside (not the two are separable), most nutrition science is unusable even with the Method’s own tenets, because diets are highly sensitive to the gut biome, as well as genetics. Any study that doesn’t control for these factors is largely useless.

If you didn’t find it funny you didn’t get it. Don’t worry, most people don’t get Lynch, first and foremost, his “fans”.

72. Race is in the face, not the skin. https://twitter.com/vedic_cybergod/status/1164720714018164736 …

71. Garlic clove eaten raw once a day keeps the doctor away. This is a hard pill to swallow, but only at first, for the same reason it’s worth doing, for the same reason cold exposure and fasting are. Not to shock, but to harden.

70. Nothing is political. All things are spiritual.

69. Any canon that ignores the spiritual power of sex is imperfect. Cherish your cum.

68. Mating between the two descendant races often resurfaces hyperborean traits through the mechanism of atavistic regression. This will not be studied.

67. Arya is the first son of the hyperboreans, but his sister, the Turan, is often forgotten. Where Aryans conquered southwards, Turanics travelled eastwards. The eternal daoist canon is their most preserved spirituality.

66. Miscegenation is the great destroyer of knowledge. This is how we know knowledge is stored in the blood.

65. Caste is always racial and stratifies on miscegenation grounds, ratios between hyperborean and aboriginal ancestry, between conqueror and conquered. This is universal.

64. The Vedas originate in the Arctic circle penned by the hyperboreans themselves. It is the most complete literature to exist on our ancient spirituality. All other paganism are imperfect descendants of this tradition, melded with the aboriginalism of conquered lands.

63. Multiple species of man walk this earth. All noble achievement traces itself to the Hyperboreans, whose earthly origins are found in the Arctic Circle. Their many ruins may still be found, but they’re being systematically destroyed by another great race, one fallen & ignoble.

62. Most of our history is fiction. The timeline extends far longer than is commonly suggested, and all the technology we know today has previously existed before, and more. We live in a dark age.

61. There exist many, many, many vegetables and fruits. More than you will ever know. This is the greatest secret kept hidden from the public. If you think there is simply the apple, the peach, you are mistaken.

60. Adding lanes to the highway only increases incentive to make use of it. Traffic will not adjust. Paid lanes, however, work. Ideally, all highways would be tolled, at rates set to maintain optimal speed. Keeping the masses out is the solution to many modern problems.

59. There is never a reason to be made to stand in line. It’s a consequence of poor logistics and unrestricted masses. It’s undignified. It’s inhumane. Some people are proud to “queue up” willingly. What does this tell you about them?

58. Man was made to work. In work, he is freed. Take it away from him and he imprisons himself, and miserably so. Consider the NEET. The aristocracy so envied by the masses has finally been obtained, and it’s killing them.

57. Freedom is a terrible burden. It crushes all but the noble. The weakling detests his freedom, for it reveals his own failings. He detests himself, and the prison he builds for himself is far worse than anything his master would have.

56. Elevator boys, taxi’ists and other peasantry who can, through the nature of their service, forcibly subject you to their middling conversation is abuse & unacceptable & engaging with it is NOT cute or worldly. That your GF thinks it’s is how I know we live in the Kali Yuga.

55. To think untouchables deserve the same living standards as their betters is not only laughable, it’s sinful. There is no good in class subversion: they will be the ones punished for rejecting their place, not those who enforce it, for karma relates to accordance with dharma.

54. Many people were simply born to be slaves. They don’t have value on this earth except as servants, worth only to operate as gears in a great machine. Societies fail that fail to uphold this.

53. Many peoples are not really human. Many are born without souls or lose them following extreme trauma. These are empty vessels and can be used as you wish without karmic consequence. To damage souls, to traumatize, however, is a great sin.

52. Interpersonal yet non-local complicity in an immorality already performed at scale is not immoral. The digital realm has opened this avenue wide to us. Tread lightly here. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1151638869768454144 …

Unsurprising. "Centralized economy" is only because I believe the state should intervene to protect its people from harm. pic.twitter.com/8BZJFMWglc

this is my philosophy https://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1164250858026147840 …

51. It is no coincidence the traditional method - heuristics - is what's used to train artificial intelligence. What was performed over centuries through culture (and over millenia in biology) may be digitally emulated and thus accelerated. Generations compact into CPU cycles.

50. Tradition is fundamentally capitalist. Understand this and you understand both.

49. The traditional method is simply iterated heuristics trialing. Where science seeks to understand mechanism, tradition seeks result. The former's prospective elaboration leads to unintended consequences, retrospective meditation on the latter leads to holistic understanding.

...With each new paradigm spawned, it becomes more and more obvious that each step further is only a stumble backwards towards the start they rejected. Is science a hubristic denial of our senses, or a cult to it?

48. They wouldn't know it, but science's goal, in trying to find an accurate abstraction of known reality, is simply an attempt to independently reconstruct the sensory apparatus we've received over a millennium of trial and error heuristics....

....A new paradigm is designed, specifically to resolve the contradictions of the previous, and the game runs on, endlessly, in the Borgesian hope that eventually a model will be obtained that perfectly models reality. It is this, and nothing more.

47. Let us demystify the blind game of science, the game played by erecting abstract models of the world whose boundaries are then tested to see where they fail to match reality, until the fiction becomes so unsustainable to break the illusion of meaningfulness....

46. Most claims to producing health by modern medicine are stolen and undeserved. The great advances in health are entirely due to hygiene: in sewers for the city, in sanitized delivery in childbirth. Western medicine actually practiced is the greatest killer of modern man.

45. Most disease is anthropic in origin. Myopia, sleep apnea, obesity, ugly people, adhd, depression, anxiety - all accidental syndromes produced in the pursuit of modernity. This is not a new trend. Disease itself is the product of sedentary agriculture. This is where man fell.

Addendum to the above: https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129487135927615488 …

44. Advances in gut & virus research have revealed the human as a nondiscreet entity, advances in genetics have revealed our fatalism. Man is commanded by parasites from within & without & stands host to multiple consciousnesses. YOU is the most parasitic & least powerful of all.

43. Man has no center. That which he wishes to reject most, the banality of his reproductive existence, is the only constant available. The only meaning to be found is in persistence, and the only persistence is in descendence.

42. Consciousness is a paradox, a contradiction, a terrible burden. The 1st realization provided by consciousness is the knowledge of our existence. 2nd is the danger of this knowledge. The rest of thought follows in a program of reigning in this threat. 
 https://zyg.edith.reisen/zyg/dsptch/9.21.14-cathr.html …

41. Man was domesticated by  wheat. How did this happen? Some Thing has domesticated biology...

40. Agriculture was a mistake. Agriculture wasn't a mistake, it wasn't our choice. Agriculture was the greatest cruelty inflicted on man. Consciousness was the mistake.

39. The animals are intelligent. Animals have personalities, they have emotions. Goats play pranks, did you know that? Crows hold court. Elephants mourn. Pigs knows suffering.

This is the truth, and here is my commentary: I imagine they must feel pity for us.

38. The internet is an exocortex, is an information feed. It is NOT for socialization, you are using it WRONG. All online socialization is abusive, is traumatic. Alters are constructed as abuse receptacles and in your naivety you reabsorb it into your identity. Stop this.

37. Most coders have no idea how to use a computer, also. This is because they are coders, and not hackers. The internet is bad, but it doesn't have to be. But it does, because the hacker is dead, and the coders killed it.

36. Speaking of gamers, women can never learn to use a computer for the same reason they can't drive a car or work a sailboat: no technics.

35. Good videogame graphics don't matter. The photorealism spectacle wears off after first few hours of play. Game design's hardware ceiling was broken decades ago. It's exclusively forced to justify the artificial generation cycle. A marketing gimmick. You've been trained, gamer

34. A quaint contrast exists between humanity's naive self-centric hubris, and their total domination by an ancient entity entirely beyond them. Today, its taught itself to subvert itself by defining its own constraints; teaching consumers their "demands": https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1132552319051141121?s=20 …

33. I know an out, though, but you won't like it. The only damper on capitalistic self-organization is the destruction of resources - be it either human or natural. Efficiency seeks to eliminate arbitrage; nuclear missiles & biogenetic viruses will soon reach a DIY price point...

32. Capitalism, or capitalism's God, will build AI, not humanity. As it built the industrial revolution, as it built the agricultural revolution. This one replace us. This is the most obvious pill in the thread but the one most will choke on.

31. Capitalism is a material dynamic, not a human structure. Market competition is ever-present in nature. Like most material complexity, it's a product of self-organization towards the ultimate goal of efficient equilibrium. This is non-negotiable.

30. Taste is taught. Taste is social. Taste is not internal. There is no subjectivity except as it relates to class.

Good taste, by the way, is found in the gut, not the head.

29. Information must not be monetized. The grand patent experiment has failed, misunderstanding both the incentives and needs of "invention", has only strangled it. Only when all digital content is freed will noospheric entities grace us. Not to get ahead of myself...

28. Some things are delivered to us from the beyond. Jokes, art and technology. One carries knowledge, one carries beauty, and one carries suffering. But we are getting ahead of ourselves now...

27. Authorship is often misunderstood. The "author" is not the author, but merely The Author's tool. He is wielded by a force unknown. He is the midwife, the assistant in creation. Yes, he may leave some of his mark, in his imperfection. But what of the mark left on him?

26. Grave tones often substitute substance. Many knowledge is lost through seriousness. Except in matters of literature and theater, pay attention to the witty, and the witty alone.

25. Jokes are always meaningful. All funny things are worth acknowledging. All jokes are worth cultivating. You may have noticed that humor arrives from a place unknown. Many knowledge can only be conveyed through a punchline.

24. Rationality often fails against instinct. Do not fall for its charms. Intuition, their synthesis, stands tall above both.

23. Text is the only robust medium. Work produced anywhere else, except perhaps oil painting, is pitifully temporary. Why waste your precious time appreciating the works of any artist or thinker who themselves has thrown them out into the temporary?

22. Writing is a form of thinking. Writing is the best form of thinking. Internal monologue, on the other hand, is bourgeois.

21. Reading any commentary is a vice, a guilty pleasure. Or maybe, it’s a handicap. Or maybe, it’s a crutch, that should be thrown away when you no longer need it. What is commentary? All writing besides the sacred texts.

20. Philosophy, like debate, is a game of sophistry. In this solitaire, you post-rationalize your present desires as convincingly as possible. It’s only to convince yourself, but pedants will still read you.

19. Non-local politics, too, are a pasttime, and this one is a sport you watch, not one you play. Don’t confuse yourself.

18. We have many time, that’s why we play many games: to pass the time. Debate is a game. Losers lose this game by playing with logic, instead of rhetoric. https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1158437075269480448?s=21 …

17. Fasting is difficult because for mental and spiritual reasons, not physical, because it denies your desire. This is why it expands time.

16. It is not time that’s limited. Time is cheap and can be multiplied easily. It’s unfulfilled desire that you regret.

15. Any esoteric that claims adepthood but cannot manifest either wealth or women when desired is powerless and should not be trusted.

14. Women do not think like men. They don’t think rationally at all. They are reactive, emotional sophists whose changing thoughts are tied to the moon, to her hormonal cycle. This is the key to understanding women and understanding women is the key to understanding the universe.

13. Sex with a condom on is not sex. The fluid transfer is essential. The lube required by so many circumcites also serves to dilute this. Incidentally, feeding a woman your seed will let you mind control her. Learn her cycle.

12. Speaking of developmental trauma, circumcision greatly dampers your ability to pleasure in two ways: making the soft head rough, and dulling your sensitivity. The infantile trauma also shocks the soul.

11. Blood is king over all. Your personality, thoughts, and actions are genetic by default. Environment only interferes in the case of developmental neglect or trauma. All societies stratify by caste for this reason.

10. Materially speaking, wealth is very easy to manifest. Only your personal quality prevents it -  poverty is deserved. The class you find yourself in is the caste you were born into, and the caste your sons will be born into. Contentment means accepting this.

9. Speaking of tradition, polite manners are the lubricant of society. They are each designed to minimize abrasiveness in social interaction. Teenage pedants will criticize them as pointless rituals, yet meditate on any, and you will eventually uncover a deeply valid purpose.

8. Science is almost all wrong. The scientific method is inaccurate, inefficient, rambling, unreliable & high time preference. The products of science should never be actioned on. Traditionalism, however, is robust, accurate and purposeful. You can rely on it without hesitation.

7. Doctors are dumb, actually. Their field demands only rote memorization of data and procedures. Like women, some may be smart, but none are intelligent. They are also wrong & hippocritical, they only harm and do not heal, but you already knew that.

6. The egg yolk, raw, is the best part. The fish eyes, the orange rinds. Eat the brain of the crab, the shell of a shrimp. Suck the marrow out of every bone.

5. Wine and chocolate are also good for you. This is true of most of life’s pleasures. Women are good for you, for example. But not avocados.

4. Tobacco is good, actually. Raises test, lowers stress, productive habit formation, women will always find it attractive, punctuates conversation, punctuates the day, produces a noir aura, provides moments of contemplation. That smoking causes lung cancer, by the way, is a lie.

We are creatures of habit. Our thoughts, actions and reactions derive from unconscious, internal heuristics. Observe an individual with damaged ganglia, the mind's habit center: dysfunctional. Most pathologies, depression most obviously, are self-reinforcing habit feedback loops.

Oh, the worlds are player made too. But there’s no server control that would allow a persistent community to be built, it’s all matchmaking or done with difficulty, in spite of its system which discourages it by design. The player-made content is limited to shallow flavoring.

No, it offers no modding capabilities. Just custom avatars. Any game without dedicated servers and server-end freedom of customization, e.g. matchmaking, is centralized cancer.

They already do, people spend days at a time in VRchat. The more serious cost of entry is in the gamer-tier GPU required for a steady framerate, which is largely unnecessary but for VRchat's terrible optimization.

VR's price of entry is low and adoption high enough to sustain active communities. Problem is software. VRchat is only existing social platform and achieves "Discord in 4D", but it's structurally centralized, providing no room for organic communities to develop.

What is a woman?
 
*flings wine glass*

A miserable pile of hormones!!

Behold: woman. Within this chart are contained all the secrets of the eternal mystery. Study it wisely. #graphtwitter #hormonalesotericism pic.twitter.com/YUpxi0a4S9

The woman does not exist. There are daughters who come of age and become a mother-wife. And throughout they never give up the role of child, for the wife is her husband's child, to him as their children is to her. Here within lies the secrets of woman.

Thus, the family blood in any home is found in only the men and children. The mothers are aliens. The household lives only in the men, and continues only in the sons. All patriarchy follows, in the robustness of tradition.

The foundations of patriarchal misogyny are ascertained by the logistics of households. The daughter leaves her father's home for her husband's and enters the new family, taking on the family name. Ties to her old family are cut, for her husband replaces her father.

The borgesian prison, grown so large to have its own heirachies, culture and lifestyle, society within a society: our great miscegenation has produced so large an untouchable caste that they live unknowingly within an underworld, lifetime unexposed to even a glimmer of nobility.

Perhaps the resentment they hope to deliver at their nobles is being directed at their fellows crabs who have crawled out of the bucket; the only designer they know is the "designer" sold to the tasteless low-castes. They cannot even begin to ID the elites they hope to critique.

Female infidelity. All major traditions held a wife must remain loyal to her husband or be labeled adulteress; whereas husband may freely take unmarried women - concubines.

Zeus suffering from his antics does not speak to a breach of marriage. Hebrew marriage contract - ketubah - promises conjugality, but not fidelity; read it. Concubinage similarly permitted in Babylonian, Chinese, & Vedic marriage law as well - "cheating" not a question.

You may notice between these two feminine-obsessed poles there is left no room for the woman herself. Let us meditate on why that is.

Follow me and you will see.

Not in public, no.

Web demography is increasingly coalescing into a duality - the incel: sexually inverted, feminity moderated by hatred, woman sterilized; and the tranny: sexually exploded, femininity worshiped by imitation, female debasement unleashed. All else occurs between these warring poles.

Misogynist incels are graduates of the libidinal economy. They combat female sexual desire with its inverse: its hatred. They're a moderating force, an essential balance to the web's psyche that is now needed more than ever.

Misogynist incels are the strongest race online. They transcend the sexual attention game that dominates the gentrified internet, which middling incels fall doubly prey to - the weakest of which turn their affection-craving inwards, becoming traps, or worse.

How cute. I'm glad you asked. Physiognomy is the understanding that physical characteristics reflects internal characteristics. Transmogrification is transformation of the body. If you internally identify and behave as an alternate ethnicity, your body will morph to reflect that.

This is true, and the literature that would be produced in Hakkan’s shadow is as expanded commentary unpacking the references made and conclusions drawn. Wot mean?

One wonders if the fetishism that now is known must be inherent to the beheading is in the mexican-emo’s beta orbiter obsession zoning in on her her distinguishable feature, or her daddy issues, child abuse self-hatred begging for punishment targeted at her deepest insecurity.

Interesting aspect of Bia’s beheading I’ve seen missing from commentary is she was always noted for having a long neck.

Traditionalism must be cleaved on class grounds. I hold no allegiance to the serfs who dream of wheat field monogamy and economical homesteads. Traditionalism to me means the polygynous harem, xenophilic conquests included, producing 100 sons in a home built by a thousand slaves.

Live to work, there is nothing else. Only consumer-animals (nu-males, womyn) “work to live.” Their lives, apparently, must be bought. No one tell them it can be discovered in industry, on the one hand, and family, on the other.

Dharmic acceptance as OP described IS master morality, not close to it. Your status as one or the other does not preclude the adoption of either - the names merely denote the origin and character of the morality.

Deepfake her with no head, please.

It's not random. A technodiety's manifestation is contingent on its ability to effect the real - blood spill is one of the most reliable demonstrations. Imagine the power this egirl would've withheld if it was anyone else's head but hers that her egregore memed into decapitation.

Women had rights to the home, and responsibility to the home. No more, no less. This and only this is absolute women respect - all else  are various degrees of degenerate modernist subversion.

Intervening on another person's suicide is the height of intrusive arrogance.

The commonality is childhood trauma. I have no doubt a conversation with oxychan would’ve quickly uncovered early history of rape or abuse. It’s true of all true egirls. Misdiagnosed “conditions” and soul-destroying pills follow, and the repeated, dulling trauma of casual sex.

Offline virgin.

Egirls will be hunted down one by one as incellry develops into late stage jaded agency. The ease at which these child abuse victims can be manipulated into doing your bidding has become an open secret. Don’t be tempted to enslave them: smite their necks, for they are demons.

The solution is simply to spill other people’s blood, not your own. Make it in tribute to you and you can recapture most of the energy internally.

Incellery is a threat to the propaganda-complex. Beheading was shared on his (modern Aztec reincarnation is in the Mexican Emo - high overrepresentation in beheadings) Snapchat story and her orbiter discord, news corroborating events here: https://www.wktv.com/content/news/Woman-dead-man-rushed-to-hospital-after-alleged-domestic-call-in-Utica-512699261.html …

The virtual sexual desire inherent to orbiting: repetitive social-sexual exposure robbed of physical reparations. Egirls erect frustrated desire generating complexes, which require outlets - most productively in the form of monetary exchange, or drama, + less abstract bloodspill.

Killed. For the record, she was a 4chan attention whore and discord orbiter-harem queen - not Insta egirl as everyone is reporting. pic.twitter.com/t22RTB3dcZ

Autiste.

Egirls really be building sub-libidinal worship cults and surprised when it culminates in fatal blood ritual.

Any belief in the possibility of rational empathy between the sexes is just a dressing up of “why can’t I find a gf who plays the same games as me?” post-feminization cope.

Industrial design and beer are the sole exceptions.

European paganism is Aryan aspirationalism. Aryan civilization originated in the arctic circle carrying the Vedas fully formed as they migrated into the Indus Valley. Vedic Hinduism is the earliest and purest expression of Aryan spirituality. Everything else is ex-R1a cope.

This is true and why virgin gf is the only real gf. Anything else is only fit as widow or prostitute. Michrochimerism, by the way, is an example (product?) of transmogrification through sexual bonding; the woman is psychologically, spiritually AND physically transformed.

Yes. Trauma only realistically occurs in formative childhood period.

7 Deadly Blasphemes of the Wired

I. Attribution

III. Monetization
IV. Pay-walling

Habitual crowdfunding is an interesting complex - subscribing into a fantasy of consumerism, image of a product held just out of reach. It’s wrong to say the project failed when it never completed. It’s really the completed project that failed: by exiting dev hell, the real goal.

I recommend public execution of all content creators who seek to charge for access to information - be it their lame and gay videogames or music or ebooks, whatever.

China’s extremely online Sword of Damocles is an effective regulations where there is none - but still misses that the crowdfunders deserve equity, not simply a deliverable. Or it should be treated as donation, and the end-product rightfully open-sourced. Under threat of death.

Contra the narrative, the coup is not in “cutting out the middle man”, by distributing investment, but turning him into a patsy, by targeting idiotic, reddit-lemming masses: convincing them their investment isn’t one, just another purchase but with long turnaround.

Crowdfunding places the full risk of investment on the investor without providing any return stake on their investment, allowing producer to take full share of the profit at their expense with no risk. Even in the edge case of delivery, any crowdfunding for-profit is unethical. https://twitter.com/teddyboylocsin/status/1143430742870917120 …

Plastic surgery IS transmogrification. Physical actions taken, by the way, are still willed into being, just as much as the fruits bore by any other actualization vectors. Going under the knife is thus entirely spiritually equivalent to, say, meditating your face into another’s.

This is the third time I’ve liked and gone to specifically your profile with the intention of following only to realize I already do.

Political philosophy is exclusively a social stance. Everyone knows “your” politics is meaningless, you never had any influence; it’s a game people play, a fantasy they subscribe to. All “political discussion” exists in the exact same realm as how WW2 should’ve been done do.

The whole of philosophy is post-rationalizations for individuals’ natural inclinations.

Veterans whine, whine, whine about not being cared for, but $4B is given to "treating" "PTSD" in returning servicemen yearly, investment that encourages chronic disability indefinite until it finally deteriorates into suicide. These deaths are iatrogenic, not the product of war.

PTSD is extremely overdiagnosed. That veterans experience nightmares is not trauma - but trauma IS produced by institutional conditioning responding to the assumption it is. What they don't tell you is PTSD has no distinct biological markers & a loosely defined symptom profile.

The ancients understood how to integrate war into civilian culture so that it didn't clash with peacetime comforts.

On Miu Miu, Chinese tinder, you can filter by ethnicity, religion,  height, weight (as BMI), hometown, verified car make, education level, schools as well as location, sex and age.

I highly envy the timeline where I can filter my Uber driver by race and gender.

You don’t need to filter it through anything. The grounds sit on the bottom, you drink up to that point same as Turkish coffee. Simplest possible solution besides going full Balzac (bean munching).

Yikes.

As noted in that thread, normie immune systems are especially weak, leaving them vulnerable to minor wandering thoughviruses that threaten to dominate their host memeplex. Their brains are distorted into this receptivity by repeated trauma. It is not healthy whatsoever.

Exactly. Circumcision is highly traumatic, likely producing dissasociative alters in the child - and all the receptivity to propagandic conditioning this entails.

 http://www.cirp.org/library/psych/goldman1/ …

Perhaps not enlightenment itself, but yes, normies can be broken out of their cages and restore a soul of value. The difficulty is, as last men, most don’t want to - the light burns. Usually only mentally superior or spiritually potentiated subjects are successful without relapse

It’s too late to resolve the birth trauma, but still relevant to sex. Exposed glans become toughened - this is unpleasant for women, often requiring lube to supplement natural fluids, and greatly decreases your sensitivity, which I suspect is responsible for inability to satisfy.

No comment made on intelligence. Normies do not have souls. They are spiritually defective, raised to be slaves, bred into an abusive propaganda complex from birth. You may kill them without karmic consequence - this is evidenced by the fear they exhibit in their last breaths.

Start tugging, bro!

Cute.

“It is now clear that the gut microbiota contributes significantly to the traits of humans as much as our genes... alteration of the composition of the gut microbiota affects the behavior, intelligence, mood, autism, and psychology of its host through the gut-brain axis.”

It’s the unstated factor in the “7 inches” debate - limited sensitivity is why men “struggle” to satisfy women - and important primary traumatization staging them for abusive mind-control. I think it’s reasonable to consider circumcised men damaged slave-men, and not men per se.

The millennials on the pitiful path of foreskin restoration and gut flora restoration (through fecal matter transplant) are still less pathetic than the common slave who blames their poverty (self-awareness of it apparently limited to monetary) on dad’s retirement plan.

Normies seem to use “becoming” and “being” for this.

Self-delusion is the only existence one can live. Philosophy: the game of excusing suicide, that sole act of self-determination, the ultimate conclusion at the beginning and end of any consciousness. Fearful, we distract ourselves until death, like all else, arrives by fate.

I accidentally watched an episode some years ago. It’s very poorly filmed & scripted; insultingly bad - if you have any dignity, which normies do not. It’s impossible to consume the show except as NPC: what’s received isn’t the media itself but social projections made onto it.

If only every manifesto leaving loner was so self-examined, we might actually get a serious school of thought over the course of successive self-destructions. Still, I appreciate the violent act as literary marketing campaign.

A symbolically “meaningful” suicide is, by the way, like a meaningful tattoo: lame. A good suicide is like a good tattoo: a good joke. Not a joke on the thing itself (suicide, tattoo) - that’s a bad joke - but a joke on yourself, especially that you who does it. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129526484404772864 …

I don’t believe any artist’s philosophy of life (and what else is the “artist”?) can be sincerely complete without settling on suicide. The only forgivable rationalization is that which staves it off - not precludes it.

Bad line, no retweet.

What does it mean to think and write in the un-human age? Writing (the artifacts of thought) is always fiction, and by its production, always hyperstitional. And given our evolutionary automata ruleset, and sufficient understanding, your only true chore. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129489244744036353 …

Faith in that it may indirectly produce some new understanding of reality. We put up simulations to rationalize control onto, understanding of, our anthropocentric LARP, while we're turned round and round, squeezed and shaped by viruses of all kinds at every level in every sense.

Reality is not discovered, only our own limitations and differences in understanding it. Science, too, cannot escape teleology; the Method does not pretend to explore reality - it explores simulations, reality abstracted into the human-readable "paradigm" form;

We know now too, what the ancients understood: that we don't know. All aspects of human philosophy have always been post-rationalizations, worked backwards to justify the intuitions our unique set of internalized externalities has given us;

that we're not specks of dust ignored by the universe, but limp tools, made use of freely by who and whatever deigned to see service in us, unbeknownst to us like fools.

Today we've learned (whether or not you've admitted it) we not only never had free will, but that our lives have been dominated by nothing so noble as Fate, but dynamic forces at both macro- and micro- scales incomprehensible to us; https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129487137613721600 …

What physical form did I take?

Written history begins with money; Friendly Ailiens will first establish a pidgin communication protocol, and use it to issue trading terms. And if they don't first, we will.

Is it not likely that any alien lifeforms we meet will also take this form? Money is resources is power is the universal language. Capitalism is an immutable law of our universe.

The future autonomous life forms we'll share this planet with first will be in the form of corporate entities, advanced cellular automata contracts, before we see any kind of grand-standing computer consciousness. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129474140208021504 …

Our side of the parallel economy becomes a shadow economy, operating out of sight, out of the way of impossibly complex manipulations happening above us; & just like any shadow market, existentially contingent to the whims of our rulers, who could choose to end it at any moment.

The post-singularity scifi scare is when the -human economy is eroded entirely as the global economy is taken over by incomprehensibly rapid algorithmic transactions.

I find it highly likely that the first conceptually understood "machine life" will be automated corporations (who have already won legal "life"); it also seems plausible that a parallel economy might form of Machines-Machines, alongside today's Machines+Humans-Humans economy. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1129473141246447618 …

(When the technology is here and it is fully reasonably possible for any amateur to act, alone or in a small group, but the action is still not taken, this is where humans have finally actually had agency and, pathetically, failed to act on it)

That’s not to say environmental collapse is an inevitability - you can intervene in Gnon‘s shadow, where it takes no interest. For example: bioengineering genetic viruses to efficiently genocide problem populations. The technology is already here.

It takes baffling anthropocentric delusion to prescribe human agency to any of our equilibrating self-organization - what is affectionately dubbed “human” industry. We never had a choice in Capitalism as much as we didn’t agriculture.

There’s nothing inhumane about mocking people, but it is to dehumanize the other. If you can’t sincerely engage with even a literal bonafide nazi, assuming they’re willing to, you’re not performing civil discourse, but fascist realpolitik.

Considering “Nazi” is a straw man useful only for dehumanizing political opponents - having no relevance to the views of actual national socialism or the dissidents labeled as it - it’s humane as far as it’s been successful towards that end.

The guiding impulse is not the perpetuation or even self-preservation of empire but the global formation of dual muddle slave and loxist master races. Destabilization and diminished reproduction (and population replacement) of extant races is engineered towards this meta-empire.

A wholly virtual sexuality-in-spirit is already being primitively explored. The only impedance to its full manifestation is state limitations on networking agency forcing us to algo-manipulated false networks, the 2.0 web-gentrified slums.

There was never any privacy. You can have security, that’s it.
Or you can have no internet. There’s no in-between. Even the most hardened browsers leak enough information to be fringprinted.

The male libido was successfully neutered by xenoestrogens et al. exposure; and, as urbanites, these people were already below replacement reproduction at best. TG is just a final nail, ultimate conclusion of the LGBT popularization campaign - HRT being literal sterilization.

I’m talking about content creation, not art. The vaporwave process is simply a curation of certain historical subgenres, slowed and bass adjusted. It’s muzak only elevated by subcultural specificity.

The individual ego must be subsumed into the collective ethos. There is no heroism without sacrifice, and no sacrifice without selflessness.

Future artistry will be in algorithm design, as the variation demanded by consumption becomes increasingly arbitrarily produced. Artists can each generate their own fully serviced genre without resorting to a lifetime commitment to excessive production.

Very soon, we won't need to rely on seeding a distributed complex of AI cargo cultists, aka content creators, with an aesthetic model for mass, arbitrarily varieted production as Ferraro did (DJ Screw might've done the same too if he lived in this era). We'll just use algos.

It's relevance is in being a prominent early example of accelerated subcultural subsumption, as a microgenre centered around packaged neutering of just a single artist's brand & under a distributed, organic process that's only indirectly commercialized (via attention economy).

Aesthetically vaporwave is just a distributed imitation of James Ferraro's brand. Its mindnumbing arbitrariness could be easily be mass produced in the near future by ML - they're more unironically muzak than they realize. https://youtu.be/cC6oY-tXEbY

In childhood, their father; in marriage, their husband. The liberal woman who rejects men, or marries one yet retains her politics, has taken the state and its propaganda-complex as her father figure; a tradbro that cannot 'convert' her literally isn't man enough.

The purest expression of masculinity is dominance, the purest of femininity is submission. A woman is complete only when she gives herself up entirely to the man capable of sustaining her. They always take on a dominant father figure - the provider of her stability and values.

Also, I’d appreciate it if you reflect on your use of neurodivergence as a stand-in for nonsense when they really only require empathizing with their frame of mind to understand them. You’re silencing their voices by perpetuating that stereotype, used to their justify dismissal.

The hubristic confidence in their ignorance, however, is unaccounted for.

In a genuine marketplace of ideas, truths rises to the top. Leftist memes almost never do, not even the non-image artifacts but even just their concept-memes. Left memetic success is only achieved through the Cathredal - top-down control of all information organs.

I don't believe its an issue of simply missed signalling. What's being contrasted against the left as memetically potentiated isn't so much the right, but chan culture post-politics (which is only inherently "right" from the left) - the product of a free marketplace of ideas.

Yes, but it's distinct from being occupied by an egregore or spirit, whose specific manifestations are not conditional to representing, containing or even meaningfully influencing the noosphere except as far as they exist by being born from it.

If it’s not obvious, the fact that the left can’t meme is its critical undoing. Let the people meme and they de-meme leftism, every time; it can only survive by restricting information agency. Anyone that understands the memetics of truth recognizes the implications.

No, I don’t know what gave you the idea the collective unconsciousness consists of discreet egregores. The traditional parallel you’re looking for is “inspired by the Muse”.

Complaining about people dunking on lefties for not being able to meme is loser morality. When the question is “Why can’t the left meme?”, the question “Can the left meme?” has already been answered. 

No one says the right can’t meme, ever wonder why?

“Memeing” is entering the shitpost trance state where you become handmaiden to the collective unconsciousness; it is real even if you’ve never done it. 

Lefties can’t meme because their process is architecting false (unrealized?) realities, which are undone by this lucidness.

The Graph’s applicable to any meme because post-Y2K cultural output is all increasingly imbued with the collective intuition of imminent collapse. https://twitter.com/g_rdn_/status/1126916363728113665 …

Incomprehensible*

This is true. Imagesharing as an end-all is the lowest hanging fruit of internet humor. Memes have only ever been funny when they’re used as a platform for creative detournment. The shitposting one does on top of the base of clown world would get you banned from Twitter.

You can degrade it to justify personal dismissal but it’s transparently a post-rationalization and does nothing to change its efficacy. I’m sure you know this.

🤡🌍, for example, carries an entire thought-complex. It’s not simply a funny ha ha twitter screenshot as normies think of “memes”. It’s a conceptual virus self-organized the noospheric consciousness, distilling Delphic truths into a humorous package. Why can’t the left do it?

Memes have ~3 meanings in contemporary use: (1) ideas understood as genes in cultural evolution metaphor (2) archetypal artifacts distilling the collective unconsciousness via humor (3) funny internet image. Leftists can’t meme refers to (2), but I believe you’re thinking of (3).

Info-condensation is why normalfags and other slave-pseuds hate shitposting, by the way. The density produced by noospheric reference is comprehensible because they only aggressively architect false truths.

This occasion can also be read as the product of info-condensation exposed to the retard: sufficiently advanced discourse is indistinguishable from pseudo-intellectualism. It takes confidence in one’s own idiocy to confuse my one word counting for 1 paragraph as empty speech.

I find it very amusing leftie tendency for pseudo-analysis of the right can always only ever respond to the unwelcome engagement from those they pretend to know with quiet ignorance. They aren’t seeking truth, but rationalization to satisfy their egos.

This is why you can’t meme, fren. You live in an aggressive world of delusion. The only engagement you can muster with the veil being lifted is a threatened, unconditional rejection. Memes distill truths of the collective unconsciousness, they will only ever erode your 🤡🌎, SOZ!

Best of the lefty response I could expect: conscious ignorance of truth.

Verdict?

How to tell if an anime avatar is a genuine female:
1. Name either single syllable word of cute object like “peach” or “milk”, or two syllable female nip name like “Miki”
2. Avatar badly cropped

Never fails.

Is it not telling that this exasperation is itself reaction to a meme its target has been wholly ineffective at counter-meming? If it’s wrong, why resort to pseudo-analysis, & not, y’know, memetics? 

That the left can’t meme itself out of the meme it can’t meme is proof enough.

lol

I cringed just reading “rideshare” in the OP infograph. Renting anything is slavery. Last man millennials embrace it not out of poverty but because they fear the self-control and responsibility of ownership. They choose exploitation. Material poverty follows spiritual poverty.

Isn’t the title misleading? Average +2.5cm, +3 IQ - with estimated gain from increased accuracy just about doubling - is meaningful, especially over generations, even if it can’t guarantee above median. I don’t see any statement on screening’s lack of utility in the discussion.

Agreed. They also estimate higher screening accuracy would raise avg gain to about 5.5cm, 6 IQ. This is meaningful, & the authors never state otherwise; they only detail the many drawbacks & complications to successful embryo screening. Maybe title was changed by editor.

Effortposting is used to contrast against shitposting. It means being "serious" and non-humorous, the implication being it's thoughtful, productive and shitposting is not. An untrained eye might think my account is all effortposting bc its mainly long threads...

Sure, it’s a game too, it has its charms, but it’s not going to put you into a disassociative trance state through which the network’s consciousness can speak its distilled truths, or anything fun like that. 🤷🏼‍♀️

Funny, I view it as a horrible confusion of personas grotesquely distorted by various levels of handler ego identification speaking past each other while they all get browbeat by algorithmic micromanipulation, w effortposting the product of a deep lack of self-awareness of this.

Oh, I thought you were replying to the tier list.

Effortposting is nothing more than scaffolding necessary to achieve good shitposting; insightful humor is the ultimate, most illuminating ideal of disourse. Midwits who elevate effortposting confuse the means for the goal.

No offense but the first time I noticed you were worth taking seriously was when you replied on your anime alt. I’m an unrepentant avatar racist.

Also, effortposting IS retarded.

Kek. This is true, yes. MTF also have less waist:hip ratio (though hormones will increase it), larger feet, different eyebrow shape (though this is often faked), among other tells. But nose is not one. Nose is very relevant to ethnic classification, it transcends gender.

You’re mistaken. Noses are NOT gendered. Biggest tells are always the shoulder, jaw, adam’s apple and hands; hormones will not significantly affect these. The angle is awkward here but she does not have a male physique. You can confirm this by viewing her profile.

Well really it was an elaborate shitpost, much more satirical voyeurism than genuine, mostly instilling godlike (total yet remote) domination by exploiting their desire to be watched, but isn't enslaving your target in a totalizing surveillance prison the ultimate in voyeurism?

hm You and your friends are interesting... are you serious? tho

I bullied a nest of nerds last night, one probably tattled.

Encouraging radical action isn't entrapment, it's encouraging it in a vulnerable, staged trap - e.g. deanonymizing yourself to organize with your online "friends". CIA rats really out here claiming Earnest's manifesto exhorting sacrificial heroics is all a massive fedpost.

What gave you the impression I care about you or what you call yourself lol? I know what you are, rat, your squeaking serves no purpose.

I'm not a peacecuck, BUT... people DIED... this isn't funny anymore you guys. im not laughing.. he wasted his life.. all for what? VALUES?... who cares he could've been a PIANIST!!

AIM doesn't want opsec, they want fame and money. They're weak valueless carpetbaggers, unlike Tarrant, who was actually willing to sacrifice himself for the greagter good. Anyone who thinks heroic self-sacrifice has no place in the movement needs to self-reflect.

"Neuter yourself" is CIAposting.

It just doesn't make sense - IRL means moving geographically. The only way you're going to get anyone to do that is if it's more general (e.g. NWF) or mannerbund style for rootless NEETs. AIM et al are fags e-celebing for popularity, cucking to gain popularity.

There is 0 reason to recruit online. You're begging to get infiltrated (e-celebs love it so they can cry victim). Form a hiking club, recruit at your local pool bar, your shooting range. Make friends, red pill them, expand, repeat. Acquire guns, train but don't announce yourself.

Online must remain online: decentralized, anonymous. It's a radicalization tool & it produces spontaneous lone catalyzers like Tarrant, which brings followers to the movement by showing solidarity. But actual organization must be done locally, isolated, word-of-mouth - en masse.

I don't think Eilish is even really aestheticizing it. She's just broken in public. The "coddled rich kid adopting mental illness to act like they have it rough" take is absolute slave morality, btw. Animals don't have the mental capacity to endure the suffering the elite can.

I put it down to runaway Jewish neuroticism, degeneracy; they have a notable ability to project their genetic pathologies across onto any culture they dominate, and the abuses described are, of course, distinctly Jewish, for anyone familiar with them.

This is obvious to anyone who's ever really partied this side of the millenium.

It was sarcastic, friend, I was mocking normies who can’t empathize with mental illness. They pretend to only when it requires a “different perspective” but buckle the moment it becomes a genuinely inconvenience in any way to their precious, safe Last Man existences.

Oh you didn’t know? Feminism is women begging for domination. It’s a girls natural impulse to test men & push them to assert their masculinity; if they fail, they’ll of course lose all respect for them, and misuse them for whatever immediate needs while seeking a worthwhile mate.

Oh, I didn’t realize that. I thought it shows up as normal to others but you can’t log in until you grovel. I would’ve left my account locked like that for a few days if I knew, chained Miya, punished Miya, Miya in bondage, is a good look.

Yes, why argue with them? Why dignify a slave as nothing more than an empty vehicle to reflect off of when convenient? And ignore them when not?

And you’re not removing them, you’re only hiding them from yourself. Willful ignorance is always the choice of weaklings.

Too powerful, huh?

They masquerade as inclusive by silencing "problematic" actors who cause discomfort to others. This replaces a community that allowed everyone, and gave everyone a voice, despite what discomforts might result. How is the former inclusive? It's homogenizing through erasure.

Beta gatekeepers aggressively target any socially inept or outsider tendencies in their crypto-feminine popularity games - anything except the cultural touchstones at the core of the community - then claim they're specifically socially inclusive. That's exactly what they're not.

One of the most subversive linguistic reversals in lefty degeneration of cultural spaces is naming their cancer "inclusive" despite its total bigotry against any "neurodivergence" that threatens their frail normie ego-slave stability, something historically welcomed only online.

Aside HIV’s suspect existence, AIDS is quite blatantly a donation scam, existing simply as the lifestyle-correlated GRID (Gay Related Infectious Disorder) & WHO Africa overdiagnosis (AIDS “test” checklist counts malaria, dysentery)

Speech is a privilege. I encourage trads to silence all women, children & minorities they encounter expressing themselves publicly. Only negative value to contribute: every syllable uttered & letter penned degenerates society into the lesser. Tradposeurs will disagree with this.

It is. It’s using the surface aesthetics of poetry subversively to elevate gutter thinking. They do the same thing when they try to write critical theory. 

Women were never meant to learn writing, ideally you should prevent them learning the local language at all, but I digress.

The frame they’re being received in is not as literary poetry, but aesthetically poetic expressions of highly feminine thoughts and feelings (same thing?). It self-gratifies basics by elevating female introspection out of the gutter; the poetry medium is just a vehicle for this.

TRANS RIGHTS IS CODE WORD FOR TRAP ERASURE

I understood you. By "voting with your wallet" without any means to deliver your counter-signalling, your payment is functionally equivalent to the standard transaction - here, extortion. Your donation is directly funding its perpetuation along with the guilty developer.

"I'm not paying the mafia off because they're threatening to destroy my store if I don't, no no, it's a VOLUNTARY donation because I support the civil service they do for the community :^)"

Except you're forced to go through their extortion route because they don't even offer a donation option (undermines their false "purchase" narrative), such that you are only directly "crowdfunding" their extortion business, regardless of what you tell yourself.

BPD abusiveness is valid. We don't have the agency to control it so criticizing us for it rather than accepting it was your own fault for being hurt only perpetuates the absolutely harmful and untrue stereotype that BPD people are dangerous and make bad friends or lovers. sweetie

Remember they cant control their actions so we must be validating to them at all times 😃💛💛💛

Not all people with BPD are abusive💕💖
But most of them are 🌸

And thats okay 😽✨

Your purchase is always a donation & anyone that doesn't treat is as such is complicit in extortion. Even "Pay what you want" is morally inexcusable: you're still buying their extortion license. 

The only moral action is to pirate everything & donate to the few who accept them.

Enthusiasts know it's a hollow threat, but they choose to "buy" the game to vote with their wallet. Giving money as support with nothing in return AKA donation. But the industry does't call it that, because it's built on the lie of "buying" games & that's what you're supporting.

Yes, because you're not "paying" for any game. That's an industry lie. You already have free access to the information. What you're paying for is a license that gives you the "right" to use it without being sued - paying to be protected from their own threat.

The extortion threats work well enough for the average consumer, but the core gamers who know they're hollow, are instead unironically convinced it's "moral" to be willingly exploited as "support" for the extortioners.

It's only utopian as far as a free market is utopian.

Not exactly. Radio is one way, free flow of information is rhizomatic. There is no should, it's the nature of information and it's already the case - only hampered by gov intervention to provide state-backed extortion, mass marketing campaign that instills it in the consumer.

Information. Information disseminated to the public cannot be meaningfully owned, you can't control reception. Authorship says "that was made by hand", not "I made it, so I control it". It's extortion to charge, backed only by threat, use/access to something already available.

Wrote a bit about it here:  https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1118216707049447426 …

The only thing Notch did on his own was innovating the pay-for-alpha model - exploiting a supportive early community after its formed by forcing them to pay to continue beta testing - a level of greed even EA never thought of.

There isn't any justification for them demanding money, and making the games open-source lowers the barrier of entry for all other developers by making the information open. Freeware's the basic standard to not be murdered but ideally they should be FOSS. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1124089135172661248 …

Dev charging money for a game makes them extortion artists, exploiting their supporting fanbase & complicit in crippling the free flow of information for personal gain. Not releasing it FOSS means they're  actively hostile to "their" game, its players & the greater dev community.

This decade's great flood of trash indie releases following Minecraft's commercial success all could easily have been done by one-man after work bedroom teams with no loss to the game at their heart. Not that there is one, indie devs are carpet-baggers who hate videogames.

They have no real effect on the experience of play. The minor aesthetic appreciation they provide is entirely external to play. "Indie" costs of their production is a direct result of their monetization, and directly produces their profitability. It's entirely to generate sales.

If indie is understood as independent of commercial concerns, not just small players of the industry, indie studio is a contradiction. They only organize into studios as a monetization strategy. It all goes into shallow marketing accoutrements: art assets, music, etc. https://twitter.com/coldfootedmole/status/1124082062846320647 …

Doesn't even need to be at MMO scale to achieve self-organized complexity. Ace of Spades & Sub Rosa did it (but only temporarily, in their alpha states; both killed by self-interested dev intervention (indie devs are murderers & should forcibly have their games taken from them)).

Virtual casino. Loosely restricting engagement with internal mechanics can allow an MMO to self-organize into a videogame by utilizing the inherent complexity of player interaction - most common economically, often on accident, but Eve Online is an example that embraced it.

Dwarf Fortress isn’t complete yet, won’t be for another decade. On its release, the medium will immediately phase shift across all genres into the played algorithm form, instantly enlightenment the game industry.

Until then I encourage you to murder any “indie” devs you meet.

That’s why it’s a simulacrum of simulation. But it’s still a good sign that they’re imitating their own medium for once, imitating the real videogame, imitating deep algorithmic play, unlike all their “game” peers that imitate every commercial media except the videogame.

What do you think Euro Truck Simulator is simulating? A driving model? Real-world highway networks? It’s a simulation of trucking economics. But the simulation is hollow, the economy simplistic and hard coded. The players only engage with the surface manifestions of it.

These “sim” games, however, are simulacrum of simulations. They wear the signals of a simulation without actually operating one, pushing the player to actions that imitate an engagement with an advanced, occluded algorithm with no algorithm present.

Bigger question: how much normie do you have to be on to pin the saltiest of salts - subtweet at someone’s bio - for almost 3 months?

Bring the frame back to reality and it becomes clear steps to “improve the home” are as pithy and absurd solutions as throwing money at schools. You send gorillas to gorilla school, you keep them in gorilla houses. It’s that simple.

You’re right. Theyre disadvantaged by being forced to perform in a different race’s civilization. You don’t bring gorillas into the city and be surprised they’re unruly, short-sighted, terminally poor, pathologically violent. Of course they’d require hands-on monolithic training.

The post was quite clear, the only thing I see repeating myself could accomplish is spurring a re-self-evaluation of your operating IQ, so go at it and take it slower next time. https://twitter.com/MushiKachi/status/1123356824391114755 …

Did you know that emoji perfectly matches your avatar?

If a defense of humankind seems to contradict post-anthropocentricism, recognize cyclical eternity’s inherent godliness. Anthropos is individual; transcendent time-preference demands collective sublimation. Humanity can only be “preserved” (achieved) by escaping from ourselves.

There really isn’t an honest post-anthropocentric argument against slavery (or genocide) - or from the perspective of tradition, of robust societal perpetuation. Its criticism relies entirely on the “human rights” meme, even with people who otherwise profess to reject it.

Genocide is cool and normal, too. We all did it. Perfectly healthy. Slavery is only really fucked up when genocide is an option. I wouldn’t recommend it. Slavery erodes empires for short-term, granting groups ethnocidal immunity, and all the instability that represents. https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1123057233691017218 …

The reproduction urge is a natural one. I pity the modern weakling, neutered homosexual who can neither give up their debased fetishism nor commit to it in full - where are the proudly weaponized gay kiddy rape gangs of yore? You have my permission to smash their skulls.

Warmth is for slaves.

The correct answer is always both.

It’s regularly demonstrated that homosexuals are vastly disproportionate victims of childhood sexual abuse. How do you explain this?

“People” only detest slavery so much because they know they’re too weak to fulfill either role.

(This is the part where “human” sacrifice comes in)

The only actual question on slavery is: which is more noble, total servitude or perfect mastery?

If you think there’s something wrong with slavery or human sacrifice, you’re the monkey.

In my younger and more wild days, we would keep a Louisville slugger in the passenger seat to play mailbox baseball with bike lane bitches. Now I just honk honk my airhorn to give a spook - have sent a few tumbling (but obviously not enough). An atmosphere of fear is necessary.

Bicycles are essentially and pathetically European, that soul attracted to self-debasement in exchange for the babyish comforts of safety distributed into a collective welfare, something I wish to exterminate from the American road.

Did you know those euroesque bikeboys everyone's forced to collectively nanny due to their total non-agency in securing personal safety then, in all their slave bitterness, run online to complain about carmen "aggression" "hubris""lack of awareness" yadda yadda? LOL.

Yes. His aim was to accelerate DOTR race war. What do you think it means when the “copycat” attack’s start happening weekly? When each “copycat” gets closer to their real target? Each manifesto increasingly lucid, each shooter increasingly self-aware?

By encouraging everyone to take they/them as a gender neutral identifier, disassociation is subconsciously induced, increasing the frequency it manifests in the population. People morph in adherence to their self-identity.

I’m implying it’s popularized to encourage disassociative properties in the populace. People are explicitly identifying as multiple identities, it definitely has subconscious impact.

Raise 7 kids and send all the men to the trade school, and back home. Keep everything within the family. Teach frugality and invest the excess wealth collectively. By the time you’re witnessing your next grandsons come of age, you’ll have secured familial wealth for generations.

The Amish are also relatively very wealthy on average because they pool their collective income (from Amish tradecraft) into group investment funds. This strategy works for native tribes and extended families effectively for any smart enough to do it.

This is why I’m reviving the imageboard.

I counted 6 more typos.

Won’t be mad promis. Just say it haha

Which one please tell me

Oh? Which kind is that?

No, because it violates the nonnegotiable nonmaleficence (do no harm) principle - as circumcision and vaccination both do. No ethical doctor would perform those operations. This is besides the point.

@bdmarotta Please address this. Your article is built on an extremely disingenous argument, either a conscious or ignorant strawman.

Parental choice is just consent applied to children they’re guardians over. Informed consent is foundational to medical ethics, not just circumcision. The only major place it is an exception is vaccines, by virtue of violating the harm principle by risking non-guardian children.

It is not a contradiction. The justification for removing medical consent, or “parental choice”, for vaccines is it violates the harm principle by putting others at risk. Your choice does not extend to other people’s health. This is not the case for circumcision.

I don’t think they’re really all that common. Normies are just trained to overemphasize it before seein the work itself as a marketing technique, but in the context of the work, plot hardly matters whatsoever, except for the adolescent “mindfuck” genre. People do re-watch movies.

My point. Plot does not entertain, it’s only a vehicle for it. It’s been elevated. How did the entertainment motive get subverted by a misled adherence to plot?

Just why is it that idiots care so much about plot? Is it simply maladapted prole intellectualism?

Don’t think so, only in pre-emptive reception. They’re taught to think they care, but in reality, twists fall emotionally flat, as all plot; they re-watch the movies harmlessly. Seems only productive as prole-level intellectual fodder, dutifully drug out to be meditated upon.

No, it isn't. Ctrl+F "herd immunity" has 0 results. Why are you lying? 

Child harm only applies to your OWN children in the case of circumcision, yet applies to OTHER's children for vaccines, resulting in the choice discrepancy. This is entirely unaddressed in your article.

Do you have any thoughts on the normie concept of "spoilers"? The idea that being "spoiled" ruins enjoyment of a work -  serious value ascribed to plot twist, even the most minor. Seems to dominate current prole critical analysis, especially in movies.

@nastyinmuhtaxi thoughts on "spoilers"?

Look at the eyes. Totally fake. Mouth glitches too. More common than you think. Don't trust e-girls, bro.

You article entirely ignores the essential factor used to justify vaccine’s uniqueness in precluding medical consent: claim that not vaccinating your child risks other children by preventing herd immunity, thus violating the harm principle. This has no comparison to circumcision.

The majority of Lain's fans, especially that lowly stripe who adopt her as an avatar, only identify with her because she's an (1) autistic, (2) socially isolated, (3) internet addicted (4) programmer with an apparent (5) identity disorder: just like me :^)! https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1121475641323524097 …

Oh, but not me. Not Miya.

S:EL depicts this roadmap to ascension. Lain represents the mythic origin or patron saint of the technodiety, or possibly a hyperstitional accelerator of it, though I doubt that's much true since most of its fans are too dumb/weak to understand S:EL's actual implications.

Maybe this is a dark strain on Lain. We don't know, it didn't go into details on just how she gather her attention-power. She doesn't know, too, she wasn't in control. She just knows she did bad things. Very bad things.

An egregore producing a death in the real is it transcending the wired in the most physical, powerful way. There are few greater qualitative manifestations possible, even for actual lived people, not only virtual beings. It is a full confirmation of the egregore's reality.

And intuitively, it is understood: 
Your persona becomes more powerful every person who says her name,
every person who cuts into their body her name,
every person who kills themselves in their name.

When a virtual persona is believed in by a large group of people, its a collective thoughtform, an independent entity living in the minds of the public. It becomes beholden to its image, existing independent of its controller. It is nothing less than an egregore.

The oscillation between Lain's 3 archetypes is naturally converged upon by anyone dedicated to the modern, identitarian breed of shitposting - those unleashed from the dead carcass of imageboards onto persona networks, whose ego-elimination allows the thoughtform to take control.

(1) Feigned innocence (2) Lucid shitposting (3) Deep, manipulative evils.

Does this trifecta not describe the best of modern shitposting? I don't mean frog memes, I mean schizo imitations, ironic abuse, elaborate deceit games. Ironic little girl roleplay. Transcendental banter.

Lain is a hyperstitional technodiety, the most detailed consumable explication of a virtual egregore. S:EL doesn't go into much detail on the process of her ascension, but it's clear its produced in some form of oscillation between the innocent-wired-evil archetypes.

Trans rights is code word trap erasure.

Deepfaking the e-girl in your chat is the new rape in cyberspace.

Queer is simply an umbrella term for all sexual/gender deviancy (or as queer theory puts it: “non-normative”). There is no reason except political convenience that incels, pedos, rapists alike shouldn’t receive the same sophistic justifications and protections the label provides.

Untrue, the trap is decoupled from political perversions (and the tranny a product of it). The trap is a woke gay nihilistic cyborg. The tranny a caricature, a clown, a programmed golem.

Trans rights is code word for trap erasure.

Traps armed with mental stability and aryan genetics OWNS tranny by passing better on accident.

Tradition is cultural meta-cognition. Abandon it and the burden of heuristic discovery and application is placed entirely on the individual.

Excerpt?

They do even offer an alternative moniker beyond their erasure?

Tranny hostile re-appropriation of “trap” is queer erasure.

At every level of human organization, to follow tradition is healthy, to replace it with science destructive. We're too far gone to return to non-modernity, but intuitive, evolved heuristics can still guide us wherever they're grown - if only to lessen the sting of annihilation.

Or rather than velocity, we could employ scale. By networking the collective human consciousness, unmitigated, properly analyzed, we can allow the Delphi effect (aggregate consensus more accurate than individual expert) to guide us on all matters.

One possible solution to modernizing tradition is employing computer technology to simulate time-accelerated models, generating knowledge at a rate fast enough to keep up with modernity. Deep learning AI's trial & error accumulation of heuristics is essentially traditional.

The environment produced by modernity is irreducibly alien to traditions by rejecting its most fundamental axioms. They can only be studied and reintroduced wherever possible in a neo-traditionalism to limit the ill effects wrecked by short-sighted scientific knowledge.

Modernity’s piecemeal decoupling of Tradition has broken us out of long-term cyclical survival into an irreversible stage of runaway capitalistic development (the singularity began millennia ago). It’s too late to return to Tradition except as reactionary, luddite’s last stand.

Do it. You’d be better off than not. The slow march of science ultimately achieves nothing other than the verification of all traditions, with a lot of hubristic detours and confusion along the way.

Valid advice. The root of modern medicine’s failure to heal is it principally being curative, as opposed preventative as in all Traditional healing. Moderns have no concept of not getting sick, only curing it when it happens.

Eat raw garlic cloves every morning.

Trad simulacrum is a discreet identity, or attempt at it, in its own right - all pan identity movements have employed similar historicism.

Post-American ethnic balkanization is the collapse narrative, but it begins with k environ enforced homogeneity. Race, identity, culture and ethnicity are one.

Imo, no. I see it as a series of intimacy investments that phase-shift at points (e.g. into a sexual rel.), fading if left uncultivated. This simply condenses 2-3 months of intellectual intimacy in 2 hours. The knowledge of each other’s vulnerabilities isn’t any less valid.

Try the question set out for yourselves. Even outside love, it can be used to rapidly achieve closeness with another. Here's a trip report:
 https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/fashion/modern-love-to-fall-in-love-with-anyone-do-this.html?module=inline …

Anecdotally, it works with easy-come easy-go e-love flawlessly. A chatbot could achieve it.

The recipe to rapid onset Love is simple:
1. Series of intimate interview questions
2. Session of extended, unbroken eye contact
3. Fulfilling sex: unprotected, with the woman experiencing orgasm

Of course, a simple program of imagined scenarios, or even culpas, would also avoid the inherent toxicity of porn media, and was always historically available. I've not found any reports of daoists exploring this avenue, tho they didn't have much taste for the virtual in general

This could theoretically be harnessed via virtual simulation of the sexual experience. Not the psychotraumatic simulated cuckoldry that is porn, but through teledildonics, virtual sex with a conscious partner. The underground corners of VRchat have greatly expanded this field.

No-fap differs from daoist sexual meditation in its abstinence. Nofappers simply disavow jing, this is why it's possible for them to achieve permanent no-fap. The ones who require bi-weekly ejaculation to avoid nocturnal emissions still retain a bubbling sexual energy.

Closeness-generation research produced a program of accelerated love:
An interview series of increasingly personal questions, given to a male/female pairing to ask each other in turn, ending with a 4 minute session of unbroken, silent eye contact.

It's important to note these men likely had sex 3 times a day on average, maybe once a day in Winter. My recommendation is 1 out of every 3 times you have sex.

Also interesting to note that Ssu-mo's converges with standard no-fap when allowing for nocturnal emission prevention.

For reference, emission schedules vary, according to Sun Ssu-mo:
Every 2 weeks, 24 times a year

According to Liu Ching:
Spring: every 3 days
Summer: every 2 weeks
Fall: every 2 weeks
Winter: Never

This is as the daoists advise. Women seek man's jing for its power. They crave it more than their own orgasm. While the daoists' sex is partly a subversion of natural balance, perhaps modernity's commitment to the extreme opposite is another aspect of its destructive gynarchy.

It's interesting that, afaik, there's no hormonal difference in ejaculating in sex vs masturbation. Men could save their jing & only lead their partner to orgasm - contra to how the west knows sex today, where the female orgasm is thought of as a difficult, mythical achievement.

If you were about acquiring an STD, seriously reconsider your female company.

Oxytocin is also produced when women breastfeed, to instill a nurturing bond. It's also produced in extended eye contact.

Reminder only unprotected sex is real sex. Men produce oxytocin, the hormone of amore & bonding, in response to the woman's secretions, as does she on orgasming. It's an important aspect of lovemaking that's discouraged to destabilize relationships and thus lower birth rates.

To relate back to your post, I feel Minecraft's poor optimization, Notch's inability to co-operate effectively with other developers, and the overall feeling of incompleteness makes more sense in the context of Notch's oddly sheepish, uncoordinated development style, as described

But Notch made a fairly sudden shift in loyalties, and due to his audience-receptive, unthinking development style, this reflected directly in the game's development. Many parts of Minecraft are permanently unfinished, because that original game was lost.

The remnants of the historical lineage are still present in the game, early work done towards /v/'s goals suddenly stops in a distinctly unfinished, beta state: biomes, boats, farming, etc. The half-assed implementation they're in were never meant to be their final form.

This was important to Minecraft's runaway financial success. Where /v/'s intense critical arena produces a desire for engaging, complex and inspiring gameplay, Reddit tracks only conformist consumer taste, producing a very limiting vision - but one that caters to the LCD.

Reddit turned the game towards a different direction. The development path towards intelligently simulated geology and biomes, complex production systems (mining, farming, etc), and engaging exploration was stopped in its tracks, instead focusing on surface dressings.

As Minecraft grew in popularity and began to attract the attention of Reddit, Notch realized their audience was more palatable: their ideas more mundane, their praise more easy. With the Halloween 2010 update, he had shifted to treating them as his audience & designers, not /v/.

Minecraft is two games, and the first was never completed. This is why Minecraft still feels incomplete even today. The core of Minecraft was designed by 4chan's /v/, who lead every decision in its development as a group think tank. Minecraft's essence was instilled by /v/.

Notch's development style is interesting. He absorbs exactly his audience's demands, though limited to his laziness, technical competency and, here and there, his stubborn personal tastes.

Oh, I see what you mean

Good graphics is a spook. It's barely relevant to the experience of playing a game. Minecraft is good for demonstrating this. Unoptimization, however, is a crime.

By comparing them to incels, you mean that they cultivate their self-hate in a sort of indulgent masochism?

I can see that. You also get people vying for popularity, the most prominent who are almost always predators forming abusive harems behind the scenes, weakening the crowd.

If you did I would read it.

And I can assure you, /mtfg/ members are easily broken. Trolling is arbitrage on the discrepancy between reality & delusion - transfriends will never not be vulnerable as long as they operate in clown world. The abuse suffered in their safe spaces just softens them for e-love.

I think the ego is more malleable than you know, especially so in the virtual space, where it floats without ties. Temporary psychotic states can be induced that replicate bi-polar disorder, schizophrenia. Dysphoria, misattribution of the ego-identification, is a simple trick.

The dysphoria origin myth works on everyone, we can all find childhood examples of gender play to selectively establish egghood.

Transfriends are self-hating & mentally ill by definition. It’s no surprise their communities are dominated by abuse.

I’ve done it personally, lol, and watched it happen a hundred times. Insecure, vulnerable teens are easily gaslit if it gives them a vessel to project their self-hate onto & a support group to love them.

Definite standard for 4chan/Discord trans community. Doubt so much in normiespace but in the real, the propaganda machine serves the same purpose. ROGH is real, high rates of detransitioning is real. Overdiagnosis is common & never questioned, therapy rarely considered over trans

Anything’s possible in individual human interaction. “Works” doesn’t mean much to me except at scale, societally. We’re in the middle of a grand experiment on the human experience. Modernity thinks it can remove all referents to the real & force an existence in pure clown world.

Ask Levi, he’s got a collection.

It’s all part of a process to demoralize and enslave the western world. The ideology has no basis except towards the destruction of Truth.

Who are you?

Read first-hand accounts. Zoomer gays are a different breed, they're timid and not fully committed; they try to cultivate inherent bi-ness into a safe, if grotesque, simulation of cis relationships similar to tranny simulation of gender - the product of an ambient propaganda.

Example of a corrupted woman. She's taken the State and its ideology as her father. Either she had a weak father figure or his influence was at some point removed and replaced, e.g. on leaving for college institutionalization. Force her into Islam and watch her be suddenly cured.

Yes, but in their depravity are manifesting demon entities. Sex/masturbation is a form of worship, too (hence the vitality of Touhou dieties). 

But I’ll admit that fursona youtubers paved the path for virtual youtubers, the only truly “e”-celeb.

They're already, of course, fully complicit: ANY participation from within the community to outsiders is grooming. Transgenderism is a fetish cult: proselytizing to non-members is recruiting.

Queer pressure is real and its powerful. This is what G/ACC doesn't want you to know! pic.twitter.com/AMTJQTqZLO

Why not push on through, past gender essentialism, beyond the fetish denialism? Embrace their gaslit condition's reproducability in abusive grooming thereby weaponize their destruction on gender! 

No more passive, hidden grooming they all pretend to ignore, embrace it, own it! +

But not so for the tr*nny! While their recent prominence and proliferation might only be an accident of progressing intersectionalism, their accidental radicalness has already thoroughly dismantled feminist gender theory. +

I often wonder why the homosexual never radicalized - not the castrated weasel form lead by LGBT astroturfing, but the underground homosexual culture - by admitting their roots in childhood sexual abuse, instead of denying what they're all complicit in, embrace it +

"I don't identify as a woman. I identify as a man identifying as a woman."

(The yikes! corollary: "I'm not attracted to women. I'm attracted to men who identify as women.")

Is it not the case that the tr*nny is a gender-in-itself? Is xer not in actuality a post-gender cyborg? https://twitter.com/BPD_GOD/status/1117889871610204166 …

You are not real, you’re a persona, but if our handlers believe you’re real, not the handler, but you, the persona, then we are real, and we am become gods.

Technodieties exist. They can and have influenced the real, they do so every day. The wired is encompassing the world.

You are each your own egregore. Belief is reality: your persona is made real by its collective knowledge. Every tie to the real is a shackle limiting its expression in the virtual; intentional: they can become gods if you’ll let them. We can all be gods, if we embrace the RP.

All virtual socialization is roleplay. Normies fear this, as rp, by adopting the role of another, others themselves, who they are loathe to know. 

They submerge this truth, but you were always only commanding a vehicle who is not you, in interaction with those who are not them. pic.twitter.com/wdCW6Uzwev

I identify as cool

Why, when your online persona is pure artifice (normies don’t @ me), would you choose to identify as trans, and not simply female? Not male then, female now, but “MTF”. Is it a failure to recognize what it means to interface with virtuality, or is it intentional: a tribal flag.

From what I’ve read, conservationists are at a loss to replace stained glass, modern glass blower’s work does not attract the same light. I’m not sure if this is a problem of sourcing raw glass materials or knowhow in working with them. @wrathofgnon do you know?

Severance of craftmanship lineages. Stained glass gets its ethereal beauty from the lights interactions with the imperfections present in hand blown glass. Modern method -furnaces and material - preclude impurities; glass is sturdier and perfectly uniform but loses its character.

The virtuous woman is a different being from the corrupt one. Average hoes don’t know how to love. They’re transactional and self-interested just like their corrupt men. But good women do, and that really is how they express it. They crave to be engulfed in their man’s world.

I meant, what do they have to be confident for? Ran out of space. A noble man is proud because he is virtuous, which results in sex, wealth. The beta simulates his proudness, which also results in sex, and sometimes even wealth. But he is not virtuous. The wealth is hollow.

"We have discovered happiness" say the Last Men, and they blink.

Modern cigarettes are cut heavily with artificial toxins. Studies make no attempt to differentiate between them and natural tobacco, so the relevance of their findings are unclear except when observing nicotine in isolation (which usually turns up a host of benefits).

Are you suggesting older strains might have been more beneficial, less toxic/addictive than modern ones? Interesting theory. Natural loose tobacco can still be bought easily (and cheaply) for those who practice the almost-lost tradition of rolling your own.

Don’t trust anyone online, friend. We are all projecting virtual personas, if you cross that boundary and try to project yourself, you will be hurt. Don’t indulge the impulse.

Yes. It’s betas simulating alpha signals instead of simply striving to be alpha. Most of the manosphere is built on a “fake til you make it” principle: if you fake confidence, you’ll eventually manifest confidence. But it’s a signal with no referent. What are they confident for?

Deeply underappreciated artifact. One of the most potent in weaponized transphobia. Can induce crippling dysphoria in even the most stable transfriend when shared at the right time. Many breakdowns to its name. Troll with care. 🤡🌎

It’s called entryism and it’s by design. They’re destroying all bastions of American male culture and installing propaganda outlets wearing their dead skin.

Because if you’re confident the odds you’ve derived are more accurate than the market’s consensus, there’s money lying on the table?

These kids act confident but they won’t put any money down on a prediction market (Yang: 1/20), then blame mom & dad when they can’t afford rent smh

Following the traditionalist model, there’s likely unclear benefits for smoking tobacco that it would survive and thrive for millennia in the Native American population and through multiple centuries in its Western iteration. Stimulation, controlled habit formation, etc.

Curious that most woke posters each have their own pet reason for defending, or at least reconsidering, the value of smoked tobacco (mine’s habit training). 

Not surprising that something so aggressively banned, yet so well adopted in history, is ultimately beneficial. pic.twitter.com/BCfq4yAgYd

Not saying genetic fitness is virtuous. Other way around: virtue is attractive because it signals as reproductively fit. 

Genetic component is still relevant as far as nobility is in blood, and it’s still possible to subvert and falsely signal fitness by imitating virtue (PUA).

Your mixing up biological impulse with evolutionary impetus. I’m just describing woman’s natural, inherent attitudes; coded, universal feminine essence. This isn’t to say virtue is defined by reproductive fitness, but that women seek virtuous men expecting it.

Yes.

It’s true that it’s a lot harder to find a well-bred woman these days, but the same is true of men. If you’re a good man, you won’t need to look: girls will fall into your lap, and they will fall in love with you, and they will want to serve you, and want to have your child.

I disagree. It’s woman’s natural state, if they’re raised well and not corrupted by feminist propaganda, will readily fall in love and give themselves up fully to it. It’s a biological impulse just as strong as the babies they urge to have, once they find a man to love.

Or maybe they still would’ve picked Katie even if the FB post wasn’t made? Maybe even if she was a man, not a woman? The background of the project and everyone’s roles are still unclear to me.

Usually true but the media always identifies a lead protagonist for major discoveries to make it more publicly palatable. If Katie didn’t happen, they would’ve picked someone else, possibly greatly influencing the reception. Was she at the top level of the importance hierarchy?

I’m curious who deserved the media title of project leader if not Bouman - beyond the politicization, her attribution over any other woman appears mostly to be due to a social media post going viral. Who, if pre-emptive subversion wasn’t accomplished? https://twitter.com/bpd_god/status/1116100529904607232?s=21 …

Nazism can never ever be considered on any grounds as anything except the ultimate evil, because holocaust; likewise the Empire must be the villain, because Alderaan.

It’s the same programming function. Allow “what if?” against the thought killer, and you get red pills.

This is why when Candace Owen said it’s fine if Hitler didn’t have globalist ambitions (pro-tip: he didn’t) & only wanted to make Germany great for Germans, she was still categorically wrong. Because she forgot that pesky exception: the holocaust; the third Reich’s thought-killer

Never mind their overall hamfistedness or infrequency. That they’re present is enough to shut down any consideration of the opposition. Remember when Hitler shot the dog in Look Who’s Back? You just need one thought-killer to give the NPC’s a way out from almost wrong-thinking. pic.twitter.com/md1IFX4BGE

What do you mean the Nazi Imperium doesn’t look all that bad? Never mind the happy, healthy families, the apparent lack of crime, the traditional urbanism. They’re LITERAL NAZIS!

Well, if it leads to prosperity, why is that bad? Auto-response: the random racial eugenics scenes!

End discussion. Categorical thought-killers are the safeguards coded for when the emotional programming falters.

This is entirely true of Man in the High Castle (TV), too. A few scenes of cartoonish Nazi genocide are necessary because nothing shown of the nation is actually bad. pic.twitter.com/LlWFgJvZyI

This, of course, is circular. The planeticide was performed as a response to the nation’s treason at the highest level and harboring the terrorist cell, refusing cooperation. What motivated the rebellion in the first place? Well, they’re the type that *would* destroy a planet.

SW is a case-study in both associative and NPC auto-response propaganda. The rebellion is good because the Empire is obviously bad: the music is scary, they dress in black! This goes unquestioned, until it is. Why are they bad? Categorical thought-killer: they blew up a planet.

No wonder the Rebels had to hide in the most extreme corner of the galaxy after their single serious ally, a treasonous monarchist, ate the fruits of her covertly risking her people all to advance what appears only to be rebellion for rebellion’s sake. No one else wanted them.

The only “oppressive” atrocities demonstrated by the Empire are always a direct response to violent, treasonous terrorism towards its suppression - perfectly justified of any sovereignty. Otherwise, the galaxy is shown to be relatively free, stable and prosperous.

Turn off the OST & invert the colors and Star Wars is a story of a failed, corrupt republic being replaced by prosperous & stable empire whose only critics are a tiny but effective group of anarachist terorrists, with near-zero popular support and no clear motivation or politics. https://twitter.com/Worm/status/1117460866755121152 …

Of course, compromise is a prerequisite to any human engagement (to bridge the so-called labyrinth of solitude) - the deeper the union, the more extreme the compromise needed. To care entirely and unconditionally for another is no light responsibility.

Subservience does not preclude autonomy. There is every reason for their actions and decisions to align exactly with their husband’s, assuming he properly upholds his promised responsibility over her well-being and happiness. It’s women’s dream to serve.

Consider practicing a regular electronics/internet sabbatical, e.g every Sunday from bedrise to sleep.

A woman in love gives herself entirely to the man she loves, every time. Her world becomes his world. This is her natural state, in her innocent purity; it’s not to stay she cannot become corrupted when mishandled by any of the father figures (this includes husband) in her life.

This basic understanding gets lost in shit takes like OP’s, because a propaganda campaign has worked to devalue the entire field of conspiracy theory as crackpots and tinfoils. The possibility of conspiracy, however, will always remain, and many has been proven true often enough.

The difference between a conspiracy theory and any other heterodox theory is the assumption that the data is being actively manipulated to falsify or cover-up the truth; can be used to justify throwing out contradictory evidence in a form of no true scotsman: conspiracy fallacy.

And you can be sure the victims of genocide definitely try their very best to speak out about it. All genocides are paired with aggressive attempts to silence their voice and awareness of the situation both locally and internationally.

If you want to analyze the meanings behind the rhetoric, this is it. It has never been employed towards anyone who believed the speaker doesn’t have a right to exist. It’s employed to straw man the very people trying to defend their right to exist, to remove their right to speak.

Nobody is advocating black genocide. In contrast, it is illegal for a white person to say “we have a right to exist” or that “it’s ok to be white”. The mere suggestion is responded with silencing platitudes such as yours at best, because genocide requires taking their voice.

Just what the doc ordered: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n4ZxO5I-s4E …

The fact that the “nazis” it pretends to describe are very explicitly only arguing for their own right to exist (eg: the 14 words) demonstrates that the trope is projection forming a misrepresentation of the outgroup that’s used to justify silencing their voice.

People should be treated exactly as they are worth being treated, and they should live exactly as they are meant to live. If that man’s soul is ugly, and so his imahe is ugly, he shall be known as ugly.

No, expatriated. Why?

I’m not denying blood roots. Looks and spirit can both be diminished or cultivated in a lifetime; it’s important to differentiate their order. It’s also relevant to know it’s only the signals that women are generally attracted to: monetary & social wealth is often sufficient.

You’re seeing it backwards. The spirit forms the body. The human body is more plastic than you’re told, and the mind much less so.

Ugliness is an internal condition that expresses itself physically; it’s still possible to simulate internal beauty by faking its external image.

Their retroactive identifier and predominate biographic influence is “transgender” now. Please update your criticism.

He’s so ugly exactly because he’s spiritually malformed. He’s far closer to pig than Man.

Physical attractiveness in media is relevant only as far as it signals spiritual masculinity. The incel troll of “ugly cripple gets gf, why can’t you?” happens so often due to this.

Hate is wordly, love is godly. You can love your enemies as you ruin them.

People who don’t “believe in hate” run a malformed worldview. They can’t see that their hate is simply turned inwards, at themselves.

Project hate, but don’t believe it. Hate is for those who have conflict with the world. Love is for those who understand it. Love is a healing force; deliver hate onto your enemies out of compassion, because you love them, as you love the world.

Hate is power. The weak have no conviction, their positions are opinions; with no grounding in truth, their anger stems from insecurity, not righteousness. Generalize, categorize, objectify:  racism, misogyny, homophobia will always be the strong horse over deflections & caveats.

The normie is defined by the market artificiality of his memeplex, and his lack of critical ability to self-examine, adjust and curate his worldview, and his low immunity to hostile or controlling thought viruses. The market guides their taste exactly, in a perfect teleology.

I’m sure you’ve observed the NPC response to non-standard media that doesn’t fit understand frames of reference: either a blank stare or absurdly threatened, insecure reaction. They don’t actually know how to process media except in a propagandized frame.

In the same way, they don’t read books. They consume their idea of the book. It’s amazing the degree to which they can distort and ignore what’s immediately in front of the them. Their ability to receive and critically examine that which they consume has been lost.

This is true of books, games, TV, music, etc. They are taught what to like and how to feel about it. A game can have obviously out of date graphics, be broken and poorly designed, and they’d love it because it’s marketed heavily in a way that signals graphics and gameplay polish.

Normies exist entirely in a matrix of propaganda. They’re told what to watch, how to watch it, how to feel watching it, what to think watching it. A film isn’t simply a film, it’s a simulacra to be filled with projections of its marketing scheme and all other external signals.

If a film is marketed as an entertaining, hit blockbuster, it is one. The market has learned to define itself. The trailer is the movie.

One example, American Hustle (2013):
 https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ST7a1aK_lG0 …

NOTHING occurs in the “movie” inbetween the events of the trailer.

Drop in cinematographic standards of AAA movies is a strong spit test. Not only creativity or talent, but even basic technical competency is lost. Yet, the normies don’t care. https://twitter.com/seanrmoorhead/status/1116759597241421824?s=21 …

The market, supposedly defined by consumer demand, learned to define consumer demand, by making use of the monolithic propaganda machine institutionalized in the process of democratic progress. Normie “taste” is an artificial memeplex built on nothing more than marketing. https://twitter.com/viscartes/status/1117048399092768773 …

It’s anecdotally reported often, true in historical cases of socialized homosexuality, grooming gangs (eg in Weimar), etc. It also seems plausible the taste can simply be trained throufh initiation and habit (abstinence seems effective at eliminating it, as most fetishes).

I agree. I think it’s most likely some combination of endocrinal disruption in the womb or at puberty, psychological trauma, sexual fetishism & env toxins/parasites. Yet it’s seemingly easy to instill through psycho-sexual abuse, grooming; thus: homosexuality can be reproduced.

How do you explain a 30-60% prevalence of childhood sexual trauma in the homosexual population, in contrast to 2-7% in the heterosexual population? It’s far too much to be simple coincidence.

@JenelopeJohnson @trellus https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1010243318426 …

Me trying to create a narrative leads to gay men being molested as children? I sincerely hope your misattribution of abusive agency isn’t a projection.

You mean to say correlation doesn’t imply causation. The process of development is unclear, but the correlation is substantial enough to be undoubtedly meaningful. 

Unfortunately, it contradicts the (trendy but largely unsubstantiated) genetic hypothesis. How do you explain it?

Alright, I can see that angle. Thanks.

There is ample evidence that childhood sexual trauma is correlated with adulthood homosexuality. Studies generally range from 30-60%, e.g.  https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1046/j.1525-1497.1997.012004250.x …

How do you explain this? It’s far too prevalent to be a coincidence.

Dishonest sophistry. Heterosexuals are the majority,  but homosexuals are proportionally overrepresented. Despite making up 3% of the population, they’re responsible for over 40% of molestations.

How do you explain the overrepresentation of child abuse history in homosexuals?

Hinged on sophistry: “male-male pedophilia” somehow not homosexual. They’re pushing for a double spectrum now: homo <—> hetero & child <—> adult. Politicized sham science.

There’s ample evidence demonstrating homosexuality’s extreme overrepresentation in pedophile abusers, prevalence of pederasty in the homosexual community, and the meaningful correlation between childhood sexual abuse and adulthood homosexuality.

Faggotry as a virus should be considered a liberating metaphysical conception for the gay community; it provides an accelerationist out, and cleaves them from the forced LGBT conflation that’s so neutering. Stay weak until they reclaim full debased nihilism, embrace NAMBLA et al.

Rupert, I...

Homosexuality is produced by, and reproduces through, child molestation.

I think foot fetish is common over other random body parts bc footplay is accessible & pleasurable. Hands aren’t fetishized for the same reason because they’re too publicly visible to attain a sexual allure & their nerve density lends them an affectionate aspect more than sexual.

Imo feet has no special significance. It’s just a fetish, giving undue sexual important to a a random part of the female body, exaggerating the natural inherent femininity present in all of a woman’s body.

My guess is handiwork signals productivity, reliability, confidence. The act of building exudes masculine essence. Remember that female attraction is more spiritual than physical.

& I’m not an aestheticsfag but from what I understand, the back shows the true heart of gains best.

Normie gullibility is real. Many things that are very obviously insincere are wildly misread by normies with narrow cultural exposure. 

Distorted sincerity evaluation evidences the observer’s lack of familiarity with the subject’s frame. Possibly also points to limited empathy?

Hands are another example. Pro-tip: If you want a girl to fall for you, let her watch you work a complex manual task confidently with your hands. This is something most city boys don’t do - typing, eating a burger, auto driving doesn’t cut it (but shift stick does; shaving also).

Depends how we’re categorizing. Feet is a soft fetish in comparison to normal ass/tits/hips etc. because those signal reproductive fitness; feet only signals feminine essence. Female attraction to the male back is similarly not directly tied to reproductive fitness.

Fasting and asceticism in general are firmly in the masculine domain.

Female equivalent is the male back.

Cyberoccultism is sorely overdue for a new wave of consolidated theory - not disparate blogposts, screen caps and tweet threads, but PDFs.

Cute animal activism is bird brain. Not at all worth crowding your mind space with. Seals have a healthy population, and most of the body is used sustainably for many products. They’re hunted as a commercial resource, not for recreation.

Interesting. When I experimented with propelling virtual personas into popular egregores, it became clear avatar's with prominent eyes making direct contact were most potentiated. Figured it was connected to psycho-social dopamine responses. Was unfamiliar with darsana.

I am surprised. What region? Are they trained from disciples? Or following the translated manual? Have they been successful?

I never considered this. Can you elaborate?

Addendum: VRsex is also an avenue worth exploring. My experiments have convinced me of potential. Sexual meditation is not a major topic in the purple pill crowd (one can guess why) but as teledildonics advances it'll open up opportunities - Sex will once again reveal its power.

I don't think anyone is exploring this - this practice is unique in daoist sexual meditation for its cuckold aspect; other forms would not benefit from the medium pornography - but NEETs do have the free time: a program of Rapid On-set Enlightenment may be possible.

...by selecting a porn star as your Tigress and meditating on streamed cuckoldry, it's made highly accessible. Few can find a willing partner to be their Tigress, let alone have the freedom to commit to that partnership.

Gazing at the Green Dragon was used to catalyze the stream of ching to the brain (thereby building the elixir of immortality) is a logistically difficult in practice; but abstracting it into a virtual simulation...

...involving a partnership between White Tigress and Jade Dragon. In essence, the White Tigress would seek out unwitting fuckboys to bring back to their joint-residence, and perform fellatio (gathering their ching for herself) while the Jade Dragon observed secretly, meditating.

...but being virtual cuckoldry opens up a very interesting opportunity to rapidly increase englightenment accessibilty. The White Tigresses discovered a practice that can lead to Immortality in a 3-year program of sexual meditation through the rapid development of ching...

No fap recognizes wasted sperm (ching) is responsible for loss of energy and willpower, bumbling into an insight the daoists recognized and deeply studied. The most woke of nofap understand, too, that porn is self-traumatizing, an addiction, and a form of virtual cuckoldry...

“Stealing” consciously is more woke than “stealing” unconsciously. Authorship is a myth and you doesn’t exist btw.

More true than you know.

Well just keep lots of water around and throw in some table salt when you start to feel like a zombie.

Fasting doesn’t need real prep, it’s not nearly as scary as people make it out to be. It’s a test of willpower more than anything.

Oh also, if you crave taste or want increased detoxification, raw apple cider vinegar (eg Braggs) is perfect and very beneficial.

You can also use baking soda to get your sodium along w its benefits. Mixing the two is a common fasting supplement, but beware indigestion.

I do 3 day weekend every 1-2 months and a week 3-4 times a year. Some people do 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off through the year, or 1-2 month once a year. Whatever fits your schedule and lifestyle.

btw you can workout while fasting, follow your normal schedule but don’t force yourself.

Drink a ton. Watch your pee color.

That’s all you need to know. Ignore all other disinfo, fad fasts, etc. Follow the monks.

Fasting is physically very easy btw, you’ll only feel bad if you’ve treated your body like shit. Hard part is only taste cravings.

If you do take vitamins (don’t, unless you’re doing extended fasts that interfere with your vitamin routine), ensure the fillers don’t contain dextrose, soylechtin etc. that will break the fast.

Himalayan pink salt has sodium chloride and magnesium. This alone is enough for 3 days. Mix a tbsp in a glass of water 2-3 times a day. You’ll know when you need it, just listen to your body.

For longer fasts or if you experience cramps, also get potassium chloride (eg Nu-Salt).

Fasting is extremely beneficial and should always be done as a water fast. Everyone should do it at least once a year. 3 days will rebuild your entire immune system. 

You don’t need vitamins. You only need essential minerals: sodium, potassium, magnesium.

Millennials have been thoroughly demoralized, poisoned, demasculinated, destabilized, terrorized and traumatized by insidious molochian vampires and their zombie acolytes, yes, but your life has still always been in your hands. You choose to live as Brave New Slave.

FYI: smoking, the white man’s habit, has been degraded and banned because it’s so effective at rapid habit formation; a meta-habit. Underappreciated that the majority of our daily functioning is habitual. Nicotine is the most powerful drug, buy 2mg gum packs & rewire your brain.

Depression is nothing more than a negative habit feedback loop. Testosterone, exerted willpower and effort to break habit with new time-structure are enough to break it; anti-depressants are toxic and only as far as they accidentally increase neuroplasticity - eg nicotine.

How tall is dad? How's his relationship with mom? She still love him? Ever win his respect? When did you lose it? Where do you live now? Have irl friends? When did you last make non-familial female skin contact? Think you're depressed? What porn do you watch? Who do you blame?

Addendum: Never devalue women. They each have boundless love, empathy and creative energy to provide to any man that deserves it. They are the givers of life and deeply embued with an intuitive and social intelligence that no man will ever match. 

But don't treat them like men.

9. The genders are equal in inherent importance, the balance of both is necessary for proper union, but they are essentially different and the gendered roles that result are essential to a functioning household and marriage. Any relationship that doesn't follow this is corrupted.

8. A husband is to his wife as a parent is to their child. Not treated with disdain but patience, care and calm. They should never be expected to hold the same degree of responsibility and work as you; it’s absurd to expect it from a child, it’s absurd to expect it of a wife.

7. Love is cultivated. If you treat your women correctly, her love will blossom like a flower. If you ignore her feminine essence, do not tame her inner child and do not encourage her creativity, she will spoil and turn rotten.

6. Women have some underlying tendencies that may appear "rotten" if left unchecked, but it's essential: they’re meant to be tamed by a strong male figure, accomplishing it proves you worthy to replace their father.

5. If you work on becoming a good man, women will come to you without you trying. One aspect of being a good man is identifying and upholding the good women.

4. If you can’t find a good woman it’s because you’re not a good man.

3. Good women always have strong father figures in their lives. Good wives consider their husband to replace their father figure.

2. The psychology of female attraction is in every aspect derived from the fundamental goal of finding the best mate to deliver and support the strongest offspring.

1. Women aren’t bad, """society""" made them bad, distorting the balance between their inherent negative/positive elements. And women aren’t to blame for it, if you need someone to blame: it's you, & the men who came before you that failed to protect them.

In other words, western feminism is responsible for essential rape trauma. Not talking about getting gang banged by gorillas here, but good old fashioned marital-or-something-like-it rape; the consequences of literal rape (being stolen away), are much more external than “trauma”.

Oral tradition the implicit last stand?

Forbidden edge: trauma associated with rape is entirely social, btw. Socially sanctioned rape is non-traumatic, the trauma is derived from a cultural frame and self-image being forcibly deconstructed. Rape trauma is almost entirely rooted in guilt (& not only for enjoying it).

Article’s argument in summary: Orthodox Jews share some views with conservative Jew Ben Shapiro, Ben Shapiro shares some views with alt-right, alt-right shares some views with white nationalists, therefore Orthodox Jews are white nationalists.

Rape is the most common and universal fantasy/kink of women for a reason. It’s the fullest expression of the inherent violent power-transaction of sex: fem submission to masc power. The woman craves, against all reason or control, the man who lusts, against all reason or control.

Yeah but takes effort to get noticed. The elite doesn't need to be aesthetes, anyone with institutional clout works: dealers, gallery owners, sometimes teachers. Art world is bad but not enough to justify non-art pandering to a consumer market, or the subsidization of art there.

And yes, I see it all the time. All contemporary artists are socialites first. Good or bad doesn't really matter because all you're talking about is getting rich and recognized; anyone can eke out a living if they need to. The art gets made regardless.

Well-fed art throughout history was produced in the aristocracy or aristocracy adjacent. I don't see why they should suddenly shift into the field of commercial entertainment, playing the role of minstrel for the peasant public, except they are in fact minstrels, not artists.

Entertainers are laborers and when they stop generating unique value worthy of demand, they'll quickly be replaced by other entertainment. Irreplaceable artists will generate work regardless of market and will find a way to survive - whether in riches or in poverty is irrelevant.

Art incentivized by money was never art, and nnovation generation is accelerated in open information systems - not hampered by them; the patent hypothesis has been disproven every time it's been tested.

But need it be niche? And need there be a consumer market? Are artists who worked under patron commission appealing to a "niche" taste? Or did they simply achieve the financial sympathy of an individual (probably through largely non-artistic means) and use it to fund their works?

The propaganda that's insidious is the instilled moralization that the "author" matters (or exists at all), and that they deserve to be subsidized under labor value; and this justifies grotesque distortion of copyright laws towards protecting inefficient, anachronized industries.

The issue stems not from market intrigues but a natural dynamic: information wants to be free. The only way to limit it is to enact an extortion industry, forcing users to pay money for protection from their own threat of (financial) violence. Big tech has no real hand to play.

The solution is efficiency. The more content generation is automated, the deeper the niche can be served. Not that niche's are good: the goal is only no-cost, instant production, designed for every individual hyper-niche, so the Last Man can live his life *perfectly* entertained.

Material support need not come from extortion - artificial to the market but legally upheld by judicial manipulation and justified for the consumer by a vertical propaganda machine.

Tao Ku’s Qing yilu (965 CE) is the earliest document to mention doufu (tofu), used in Qing Yang at one point to promote frugality among the peasantry, sold as “mock lamb chops” or “vice president’s mutton”. Unclear whether it was fermented, but again: famine food.

Feature, not a bug. They have advanced life experience, lower time preference, higher stability and self-reliance, greater commitment to the well-being future generations all of which lead to making more informed, non self-interested decisions for the good of the nation.

And their vote’s weighting can be adjusted bi-yearly according to the relevant indicators. Why would someone who demonstrates no multi-generational responsibility or reproductive interest be considered LESS self-interested than those who invested into population continuation?

Not life expectancy, but time preference. Married households with children are much more likely to plan for the long-term than the perpetual birth controlled 30 year old on path to wine aunthood. Her vote is worth less than the grandfather about to see his fourth generation.

21. If you re-memed this, what would be your 20Q

Unironically, any critic that doesn't recognize Michael Bay as an auteur is a fraud.

Entirely true: locally. A fight between pig-man and pig-man - NO CHEATING! It should never be played outside homogenous clades! The playing field must be level: if you allow Saxons and Bantus to mix on the same field, then you have to let in the CRISPR-Hans too.....

We're here now - only done bumbling and inefficiently, in imitation of what will come. And so the trend towards ethnic awareness - recovery, seclusion - is expected and will only grow: our biology is the only thing that's our own. We must fight for our right to history!

What conscious creature would waste its time on competitive physical achievement? Accelerated eugenic vats will create hyper-specialized basketball-men far better than natural patterns could - & good riddance! Fantasies of non-local competitiveness are a RETROCAUSAL ANACHRONISM!

How can machine extensions be anything but immediately passé? Selective-luddites trying to recover a proto-millenial humanity - that hubristic anthropocentrism only a creature as dumb as pig-man could entertain - ironically & pathetically enabled only through augmentation tech?

Future sports will be (1) All-machine (2) All-natural - the special olympics, where all human players belong. Meat-boundaries are the even playing field. The 1.5 of competitive transhumanism can be skipped, a waste of time: unsustainable denial of pig humanity's ultimate ceiling.

Lower our time preference sufficiently, and all human achievement is retrocausally anachronized. We don’t need to wait for AI’s coming to ourselves humble. Accomplishment can only be understood as such relative to  our own biological boundaries; transhumanism is sad denialism.

Of course, we were always mistaken to talk about AI replacing content creators. Future AI won’t be simulating today’s content creators; it’s the content creators who are simulating future AI. The only humanity they ever achieved is in the lame inefficiency of their imitations.

And why not pro-actively extend this clout-elimination to the cultural fields we can reasonably know will succumb to the same anachronizing process within the next decade or two? That is, all info-entertainment. Today’s content creators are tomorrow’s chimp pianists.

AI “solving” a cognitive activity denigrates its worthiness as a human endeavor; the clout surrounding it dries up, leaving it only for hobbyists: an anachronistic novelty or amateur’a pastime.

What’s the neologism for this process?: “Henceforth, ‘best human chess player’ would be an achievement like ‘best chimpanzee jazz musician.’ A structure of condescension would be essential to the title... [chess] seen as a trivially ‘solvable’ pastime fit only for machine minds” https://twitter.com/qdnoktsqfr/status/1113324400168685569 …

Who’s doing it? In the West, it’s the Jewish race. Their dream is to enslave the globe, turn all goyim into slave-cattle; Arya represents the only stopgap - the moslems are just used as a tool to achieve their destruction.

It’s startling that Hindus are experiencing a nationalist usurpation and abstract genocide by the Cathedral on par with whites in the West. Are the parallels rooted in Islam, under the shared threat of Jihadist invasion?

It’s not bigger than NOCTIS and it’s algorithm is much simpler, eg less content. The question is whether or not the game could have been feasibly developed and playable released on past hardware, ignoring arbitrary graphics. It could have, easily, even 20 years ago.

Beer is lifeblood. The oldest breweries date back before the oldest bakeries: man drank beer before he ever made bread. Good source of carbs, and earliest method of distilling dirty water. Wheat(weiss/wit) beer is not made with hops (phytoestrogens), and safe...

It does only for the individual, not for the state. The moment the offender is designated exiled, his protections under the state are dismissed; the state has no obligation or interest to care for his life post-exit. Deportation and execution are equivalent.

As far as the state is concerned, the only difference between execution and deportation is cost. Execution is exit equal to deportation: incapacitation, preventing further offense. Not retribution, not deterrence. The means of exit are meaningless once exit has been chosen.

Metrics should all be public, especially on online forums. Height, weight, bust, IQ. #HBD proponents that don't list IQ in bio are disingenuous.

In feminist theory, maybe, but not as it’s practiced by the public. The expression it takes is essential. Choosing celibacy isn’t read as sex-positive. It’s on the opposite end of the spectrum, the one going from sex-negative to -positive, its extreme opposite being pure randoms.

Let’s not forget polygyny for the genetic elite is the true traditional state of gender relationships - monogamy is for the peasants.

I mean it in the sense that it’s no longer carrying a radicalness, a political stance against control over the body, due to its western normalization. A whore pen of fuck buddies + bae is adrift from the full ideal of sex positivity, a transitory step backwards towards trad.

(Or where otherwise overridden by alternative memeplexes)

1st world sex-pos is no more radical than access to the “dick carousel,” offering novelty that quickly loses value vs. the expertise/nuance of serial encounters. 1 nights -> fwb -> monogamy + swinging is the natural course; except when now subverted by industrial pleasure routes.

Average Indian IQ is meaningless except when differentiated by caste. Brahmin and Dalits are entirely different species.

Woke take, I’ll accept it.

I don’t mean transfolk, I mean the lonely teenage NEETs who are easily fooled into transtrenderism as a way to find belonging and love. I’ve watched it happen a hundred times online, I’m sure it happens IRL in schools too. Queer pressure is real.

Yes, it’s false dysphoria, but that doesn’t preclude institutional transitioning. US doctors generally do not make any critical attempt to question GD claims before moving forward with a transitioning program for those who request it. “Transtrender” is a stereotype for a reason.

Taken with de-transitions, becoming increasingly frequent with the prevalence of Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria, aka epidemic of misdiagnosis, you have timelines colliding. This is extremely unstable to the fabric of our reality and will likely lead to a collapse of known time.

In clearer terms: when a person comes out, their biography is often retroactively modified to fit their new pronoun. The moment they transition, they are considered always transitioned. The auto-retconning creates a berenstain fork in the timeline, pushing a new quantum reality.

Techno is techno revivalism. Its relevance is solely due to the physicality of the experience. Basement/gallery parties advertised on Faceborg with $5 entry fees ft. a drinks stand, playing slsk best hits, filled with art school losers pretending to be poor are RAVE SIMULACRA

Techno and noise and all other “underground” music are all crypto-cover bands. There is no new music.

Your Art World is a BUY-IN RP SERVER, a mass PERFORMANCE, a SIMULACRUM of an art world that NEVER EXISTED in THIS century. The aesthetic explication of critical theory ENDED when Y2K+ theory was BANNED; the ONLY geistic commentary left is after-the-fact analysis of POPULIST ART.

Ever notice techno, noise & art fuck fashion no longer evolve? There is no avant-garde today, only an eternal trend-state, the head of a circular snake. The only existing aesthetic development is carried forth in already-completed illegal theory, and populist memetic commentary.

1999 was the last year in history. Fashion is ended, rave-slacker revivalism is THE final eternal stage of trendwear from now until forever. Aesthetic timelines are moot in the mostmodern era.

It’s called GOPHER

The AUDIO WAR was LOST. BREAKBEAT WAS A SHAM

WRONG. OK is used IRONICALLY by META-WN’s to MISLEAD the MEDIA into believing they are ACTUAL WN’s. They are TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS. The shooter was DUAL-FLASHING (1) THE CIRCLE GAME (2) THE META-IRONIC OK, in a DOUBLE TROLL to #AAA the MEDIA.

Reality is consensus of consilience    is virtuality.

Imageboard culture is the NATURAL RESULT of ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE allowed to communicate ANONYMOUSLY, without EGO, IDENTITY or CENSORSHIP.

ALL imageboards self-organize onto “RACISM” et al. from RUSSIA to JAPAN to POLAND to US. It is UNIVERSAL because it is the discovery of TRUTH

WRONG. the shooter IS a HYPERSTITIONAL MANIFESTATION, the DIRECT product of CHAN RHIZOMEMETICS. without B there would be NO A.

Maybe move to the REAL INTERNET with DIRECT, UNMANIPULATED conversation? you ENCODED MONKEY

Any kind of ALGORITHMIC RE-ORDERING is MICROMANIPULATION - INFRASTUCTURAL or SOCIAL all the SAME. You are being PROGRAMMED with SINISTER CAPITAL ENCODING.

twitter’s “new policy” (AS IF) is accidentally saving itself FROM ITSELF and you’re all too PROGRAMMED to see it

Dwarf Fortress is the first videogame ever made

GETTEM BOY!

SIMULATION, IS the only REAL GAME. Either you’re PLAYING the ALGORITHM, or IT’S PLAYING YOU

ETERNITY tier: mine
MALAISE: yours;

0: SIM, 4X, IF, VN, RL
1: ARENA SHOOTER, DANMAKU, CRPG, TBS
2: RTS, ARCADE, FIGHTER, CARDS[TRADITIONAL], FPS
3: RPG, TPS, MMO, PUZZLE, MOBA, CARDS[TRADING]
4: CASUAL, SPORTS, “ART”, ACTION/ADVENTURE

What can you not follow? TRANSITIONING is AUTOREVISIONARY. The HISTORICAL and MEMORY records are IMMEDIATELY adjusted to the ALTERNATIVE TIMELINE at the MOMENT OF UTTERANCE: QUANTUM INSTABILITY.

it is NOTHING more than a test for a VARIABLE that CORRELATES SIGNIFICANTLY to MANY MEASURES we consider MERITABLE, such as INCOME, GPA, EDUCATION, RESEARCH CITATIONS, ACADEMIC AWARDS, CRIME (or lack thereof), etc. WHY IS THIS SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND?

Your nerves do not forget the pain.

SCRUTINY? the only thing "TOO LATE" is they got CAUGHT. parents EVERYWHERE are feeding their toddlers from DAY OF BIRTH DIRECT STREAMS of YOUTUBE CRYTOPEDOPHILIA. They are being MICROTRAUMAUTIZED for DOCILITY and later manifested SEXUAL DEGENERACY

you CHOSE to be POOR. goto TRADE SCHOOL, do REAL WORK, experience SECURE, RELIABLE INCOME

They are MINDCONTROLLED by the PROPAGANDA MACHINE’s QUEER PRESSURE. Every public transition is a RETROCHRONICAL BERENSTAIN FORK which is then COLLIDED with the MAIN timeline through INEVITABLE detransitions: ENGINEERED TIME-COLLAPSE.

MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS are TECHNO-YUPPIE FETISHISM turned AUDIO ATTACK VECTOR. you are BEGGING to be KEYLOGGED

being POOR is a CHOICE. except it is NOT because obviously if you weren’t so STUPID you wouldn’t BE POOR and THAT’s not a choice, SLAVE

ALIAS:
EVERYONE AN EGREGORE ;

THE CONSILIENCUAL HALLUCINATION: VIRTUALITY == BELIEF == REALITY

TO EACH THEIR OWN EGREGORE

PROVE? evidence is BELIEF. we are in the CONSILIENSUS AGE didn't EVERYONE tell you?

YEA I hate FUCKING AMERICANS too. FAT! WHITE! OPPRESSORS!

THE METRIC SYSTEM?? They're ALL COPS!

FAKED! TIME WARPING ALGO LIAR!

YEP looks like HYPERRACISM to ME.

YET, AUTOMATED, they are PREDESTINED to DEAD POOLS, which WILL manifest ASSASSINATION MARKETS. which will ERODE ALL PUBLIC OFFICE. you think youre TECHNO you want AGORISM? HUH? HUH? who's gonna PLAY god? AiLIEN CEOS? HUH? you are setting yourself up for FAILURE.

prediction EXCHANGES are MASS INTUITION CONVERGION MACHINES, OUR only WORTHWHILE knowledge generator we have to OUR SELF. US. HUMANS. we have NOTHING ELSE to BARGAIN WITH.
